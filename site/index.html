                    <p class="content-text">Ten years after I first followed the proposed route, I retraced my steps to see what life was like along the world’s most expensive, heavily delayed railway lineTen years ago, I walked the route of HS2, the 140-mile railway proposed to run from London to Birmingham, to discover what lay in its path. Nothing had actually been constructed of this, supposedly the first phase of a high-speed line going north. The only trace was the furtive ecological consultants mapping newts and bats and the train’s looming presence in the minds of those who lived along the route. For many, it was a Westminster vanity project, symbolising a country run against the interests of the many to line the pockets of the few. People whose homes were under threat of demolition were petitioning parliament, campaigning for more tunnels or hoping the project would collapse before their farms, paddocks and ancient woodlands were wiped out.The line, we were told a decade ago, would be completed by 2026. Like many of the early claims about the longest railway to be built in Britain since the Victorian era, that fact no longer stands. The fast train is running – very – late. The official finish date of 2033 was recently revised upwards. “The best guess is that it will begin with a ‘4’ when you can catch a train,” one well-informed observer told me. There’s similar uncertainty about its cost, but one thing is sure: it is catastrophically over budget. When complete, HS2 will almost certainly be the most expensive railway in the world. Nearly 20 years ago, HS1, the line from the Channel tunnel to St Pancras, was completed on time and on budget for £51m per mile (£87m in today’s prices). It was criticised for being twice as expensive as a high-speed route constructed in France. HS2 may cost almost £1bn per mile. Continue reading...</p>

Perhaps it is time to let our guard downIn the early autumn, over pizza and wine, I had a conversation with a dear friend. He’s Turkish. We were in Ayvalık, a small town on Turkey’s Aegean coast, talking about cultural imprints, when he suddenly paused and looked at me. “You know what?” he said. “Whenever I ask you how you are, you never really answer. You go into a meta space immediately – talking about politics or about bigger things that worry you – but you never say how you actually are.”I’ve been thinking about his observation ever since, debating in my mind whether it was true – and I’ve recently reached the conclusion that, unfortunately, he was right.Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

By treating horror as an art form rather than a cheap set of jump scares, this thrilling new show, which wears its connection to the world of the Paranormal Activity film franchise lightly, proves how jaw-clenchingly, arm-clutchingly frightening horror on stage can be. Under the direction of Punchdrunk’s Felix Barrett, the in-the-moment fear is acute. But what is remarkable, thanks to Chris Fisher’s eye-popping illusions, is how that terror is accompanied by a giddy, awe-filled delight at the devilry we just witnessed – and how the hell they made it work.In Oren Peli’s original movie, a young couple set up home video cameras to capture night hauntings. The brilliance of Barrett’s production is in the ditching of screens, too often relied on to scare on stage. Levi Holloway’s script follows Jimmy (Patrick Heusinger) and Lou (Melissa James), who have moved from Chicago to London to escape the “spells” Lou has been experiencing. But places are not haunted, we’re told. People are. So the “spells” follow. Rather than setting up cameras, Jimmy tries to reason his way out of the chaos by bringing in an expert (Jackie Morrison).

Many of these do no harm. As the cancer specialist Prof Chris Pyke noted last year, people undergoing cancer treatment will often try meditation or vitamins as well. When such a change is in addition to, and not instead of, evidence-based treatment, this is usually not a problem. If it reduces distress, it can help.But the proliferation of online health influencers poses challenges that governments and regulators in many countries have yet to grasp. The Guardian’s investigation into the Free Birth Society (FBS), a business offering membership and advice to expectant mothers, and training for “birth keepers”, has exposed 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or other serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS. While the company is based in North Carolina, its reach is international. In the UK, the NHS only recently removed a webpage linking to a charity “factsheet” that recommended FBS materials.

That means a new economic approachMore than a year after the election that handed Donald Trump a decisive comeback victory, the Democratic party has still not released its postmortem analysis. But last week, an influential progressive lobby group published its own. Kamala Harris’s campaign, its authors argued, failed to connect with core constituencies because it did not focus enough on addressing basic economic anxieties. By prioritising the menace to democracy that Maga authoritarianism represented, progressives neglected the bread-and-butter issues that were uppermost in many people’s minds.As the EU braces for a tumultuous period of politics between now and the end of the decade, that is a lesson that needs to be fully absorbed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “patriotic” parties in Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) lead the polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters. But among mainstream leaders and parties, it is hard to discern a response that is adequate to troubling times. Continue reading...</p>

Trump also claimed Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind-crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME”.

Plus letters from Prof Hugh Hunt, Dr Portia Adade Williams and Angela Churie KallhaugeYour editorial (8 December) says that it is “hard to disagree” with calls to ban research into climate interventions or geoengineering solutions, citing well-worn tropes about a “termination shock” scenario and a dislike of private-sector involvement in the field. The pretext for forming this opinion – and claiming it represents all of Africa – appears to be the brief reference in a joint statement earlier this year from the African environmental ministers.I can’t help feeling that the Guardian is being played. Every advance in human technology elicits cries from a vocal few that a line must be drawn that cannot be crossed. Usually seeded in the corridors of western NGOs, legitimate concerns are whipped up into fearmongering and luddism, with the goal of holding back scientific inquiry. Continue reading...</p>

That’s not so. Most council estates, such as Becontree and Harold Hill, were built following the first and second world wars to house ordinary working families when decent housing was in dire straits. Privately rented properties were often of poor quality and devoid of basic amenities.The governments then believed it imperative to house ordinary families in good-quality modern housing. Relying on private landlords and precarious tenancies was seen practically as an insult to the nation’s people, and even financially well-off council tenants could rest assured that their tenancy was not going to be terminated.

Overuse of AI for mental health support could well lead to the next public health emergency if the government does not take urgent action.We shouldn’t be surprised that teenagers are turning to tools such as ChatGPT in this way. NHS waiting lists are rising, and one in five young people are living with a mental health condition. It is unacceptable that young people who require support for their mental health are unable to access the services they need, before they reach crisis point. Continue reading...</p>

There is an even earlier case. In a trial held by a German court pursuant to the treaty of Versailles (1919), two officers of U-86 were convicted of “an offence against the law of nations” for attacking survivors after the sinking of a Canadian hospital ship, the Llandovery Castle, off the coast of Ireland in the final months of the first world war. The judges said the rule against such attacks was “simple” and “universally known”. They rejected the defence argument that the officers were following orders of the submarine’s captain. They said such an order was manifestly unlawful. The precedent is still cited today and is codified in the Rome statute of the international criminal court.

It makes a start, but the proposed increase of specialty training posts over the next three years, from the 1,000 extra announced in the 10-year health plan to 4,000, simply repurposes “locally employed doctors”, rather than increasing capacity. It will not mean more doctors on the shop floor of our A&E departments – it’s just shuffling the deck chairs on a sinking ship.Dr Jack Fletcher is an acute medicine doctor working in the north-east of England and chair of the British Medical Association’s UK resident doctors committeeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sign up now!In keeping with pretty much everything else you’ve read, seen or heard about the Scottish League Cup final, you’d be forgiven for presuming today’s Football Daily will almost entirely be devoted to the fact Celtic is run by an incompetent bunch of cheapskates who appear to consider their paying customers an entitled rabble of insubordinate plebs, with only a cursory mention of plucky little St Mirren’s actual triumph at the end. Except that’s not how this daily football email rolls and by sneering at everyone else’s coverage of the Buddies’ not-entirely-surprising Hampden Park triumph, we’ve now mentioned their win twice already, which means we can exclusively devote what remains of this section to going in two-footed with our views on the Scottish champions.So Nottingham Forest beat Spurs 3-0 (lol) after Spurs beat West Ham 3-0, in turn, following West Ham beating Nottingham Forest 3-0, which is the Premier League equivalent of an Escher drawing. As Danny Baker used to say, ‘football is chaos’...” – Noble Francis.Is anybody else looking back with fondness to a time when Sepp Blatter was Fifa’s chief suit?” – Gary McGuinness.As a compatriot of Tyler T (Friday’s Football Daily letters), may I add a preemptive global apology for anything Alexi Lalas says? There’s really no excuse. As a people, we should have long ago endeavoured to make sure he never actually speaks into a live microphone. And I’m sorry to Tyler as well for bandwagoning his letter” – Daniel Stauss.Re: rival fans being nice (Football Daily letters passim) – my friend, a lifelong Coventry fan, asked me to join him at the Spurs v Coventry FA Cup final in 1987. Unfortunately he could only get tickets in the middle of a Tottenham section. Notwithstanding this he wore his Coventry scarf and we both were on our feet cheering when Coventry equalised, without any adverse reaction from the Spurs fans. Not only that, after Coventry won the match – and the Cup – the Spurs fans remained in their seats and clapped the Coventry team when they came round celebrating their win. Those were the days” – Danny Sullivan.This is an extract from our daily football email … Football Daily. To get the full version, just visit this page and follow the instructions.

Glaciers in the western US and Canada are forecast to reach their peak year of loss less than a decade later, with more than 800 disappearing each year by then.The melting of glaciers driven by human-caused global heating is one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis. Communities around the world have already held funeral ceremonies for lost glaciers, and a Global Glacier Casualty List records the names and histories of those that have vanished.

The recipes were not all that intelligent. The AI had taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. In one memorable case, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.Over the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog.

They can tell when shoppers have stayed indoors by the number of sausage rolls left in the window. It’s a Tuesday before Christmas – supposedly the busiest time of the year. But there’s still a big pile remaining.“In 10 years’ time, we’re all going to be going, ‘We need shops. Where have they all gone?’,” Marriott says. Her warning echoes widespread fears for Brighton’s plentiful independent shops, which have given the Sussex city international renown. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">ARD is set to rebrand its ARD Audiothek as ARD Sounds in March 2026, marking a significant step in the public broadcaster’s digital audio strategy aimed at better reflecting changing listening habits and attracting younger audiences. The move comes as audio consumption increasingly shifts to smartphones, smart speakers and connected car systems. With ARD Sounds, the broadcaster plans to consolidate its public-service audio output on a single platform, bringing together regional live radio, podcasts, livestreams and exclusive on-demand content. ARD says the relaunch will improve discoverability, make more efficient use of existing resources and extend the reach of its digital audio services. “Radio and audio accompany millions of people in Germany through their everyday lives. With ARD Sounds, this will become even easier in future. We are making all our audio content accessible in one app. ARD Sounds is the ‘play button for your day’, whether you are out jogging or driving,” said Jan Weyrauch, Chair of ARD’s Audio Programme Conference. Since its launch eight years ago, the ARD Audiothek has evolved from a largely speech-focused archive into a broader digital audio service. Under the ARD Sounds brand, this positioning will be further emphasised, with content ranging from daily news podcasts such as 11KM and 0630 to talk formats like Baborie & Rakers, documentary series including Wild Wild Web, as well as live football coverage from the Bundesliga and the Champions League. A central element of the relaunch is the integration of more than 40 previously standalone ARD radio station apps into a single application. According to ARD, listeners will be able to access all their favourite stations and programmes in one place, supported by personalised recommendations, an enhanced audio player and options for real-time interaction with broadcasters. The rollout will begin in March 2026 with an app update for existing ARD Audiothek users. The migration of individual radio apps will take place gradually, with guided onboarding designed to ensure a smooth transition. ARD said the platform is being developed in-house, using the same technical foundations as the ARD Mediathek to maximise synergies. ARD Sounds will also expand cooperation with other public broadcasters. Podcasts and livestreams from Deutschlandfunk are already part of the offer, and a new partnership with ZDF is planned for the relaunch. This will add podcasts such as Lanz & Precht, Aktenzeichen XY… unvergessene Verbrechen, heute journal – der Podcast and Terra X to the platform, further broadening its public service audio portfolio.</p>

All of them, that was, except two. The broad-shouldered centre-forward Aitor Aguirre and the winger Sergio Manzanera lingered furtively.“We said that if we could do something to damage this military regime, we should,” recalls Aguirre on the terrace of the restaurant he ran for many years after his retirement. “But it had to be subtle, or they wouldn’t let us out on the field. So, we slipped into the toilets with a pair of bootlaces. I tied one onto Sergio, and he tied one onto me, so they looked like armbands.” Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Reiner’s own films reshaped modern comedy and drama with their intelligence, empathy and range. But through his company, Castle Rock, he paved the way for Seinfeld, Sorkin and many moreAs a film-maker, Rob Reiner championed humour, civility and intelligence – qualities you suppose would be out of step with the Hollywood of the 1980s where he made his name, and in the 1990s where he scored a series of extraordinary, far-reaching successes. Reiner had a family interest in the workings of on-screen comedy: his father Carl had played a key role on Sid Caesar’s TV shows, which themselves were revolutionary, and helped birth a new generation of screen comics by directing Steve Martin’s film debut The Jerk. Rob had become a household name as Meathead, the liberal foil to Carroll O’Connor’s bigoted Archie Bunker in 70s sitcom All in the Family (the equivalent to Mike Rawlins v Warren Mitchell in the British original, Till Death Us Do Part). But it was as a director and producer that he really made his impact felt.In 1984, Reiner released This Is Spinal Tap, a “mockumentary” about a fictitious heavy metal band from the UK that rewrote the rules on what comedy could do. It sent up rock’n’roll behaviour and codified its cliches (with Reiner himself doing a hilarious parody of Martin Scorsese’s hosting role in The Last Waltz) and gave us zingers that haven’t lost their comedy power more than 30 years on: “The numbers all go to 11”, “it’s such a fine line between stupid, and er … clever.” Its deployment of improvised comedy was revolutionary for a Hollywood feature, and while Reiner wasn’t the first to use the fake-documentary techniques for comedic purposes (that goes back at least to Woody Allen’s Take the Money and Run), it hugely popularised the mockumentary style; subsequent efforts include Bob Roberts, Fear of a Black Hat, Drop Dead Gorgeous and Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. All these owe Tap a huge debt – as well as the microgenre of star Christopher Guest’s improv-mockumentaries: Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show and A Mighty Wind. Almost incidentally, Spinal Tap became a sort-of-real band, with tours, record releases and a follow-up feature (Spinal Tap II: The End Continues), in which the presence of music industry titans Paul McCartney and Elton John demonstrated the high regard in which the original was held.

My family, bar one sweet-toothed aunt, avoids dried fruit-based offerings, so classic Christmas cakes and puddings are a hard no. Over the years, I have tried variations on yule logs, pavlovas and sherry trifles, but the biggest crowdpleaser is easily sticky toffee pudding (or something along those lines). This year, I’m making this warming, simple but decadent pear, sticky ginger and pecan pudding, which feels festive and fancy, and can happily make an appearance whenever. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Social-media fame and sexual intrigue collide in this part-Twilight, part-OC romantic drama whose provocative dramatic set-ups feel as glib as porn scenesHere is a Spanish YA romance based on a novel by Mercedes Ron, famous (or perhaps notorious) for the My/Your/Our Fault saga. This time, we have Kami (Alícia Falcó), a confident, attractive cheerleader at her local high school with a huge following on social media, and an angry jock boyfriend who is none too pleased when her attention wanders towards a couple of handsome brothers who have just begun attending the school. Younger brother Thiago (Fernando Lindez) is in the same year as Kami, while the older Taylor (Diego Vidales) joins as a coach, and immediately begins behaving in a variety of ways inappropriate to his pastoral role. It quickly emerges that Kami and the brothers have some sort of dark and contentious history, hinted at in flashbacks and gradually revealed in full across the course of the run time.Coming off like a scrambled-together mix of the love-triangle elements of Twilight with the elite social milieu of The OC, much is made of the idea that Kami is attracted to both brothers, despite Thiago being a sweet lad who is clearly into Kami, and Taylor being someone who is constantly brooding and growling and treating everybody badly. It doesn’t really seem like all that tough of a choice, though the film runs hard with the idea that Taylor’s behaviour, which contains enough red flags to supply bunting to an entire village fete, is justified by the strength of his feelings. Hmm. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">In his pomp there was no genre or story this director couldn’t turn to gold – despite never being nominated for an Oscar• Meeting Rob Reiner was like a visit from Santa• Rob Reiner’s five best films• Hollywood in shock: ‘One of the greatest’Consumption today is driven by the algorithm: “If you liked that, you’ll love this …” But Rob Reiner was a film-maker who beat the algorithm in the days before there was even one to beat. He was impossible to predict, at least during his golden years. How could one man make the most inspired mockumentary of all time, a handful of zinging romcoms, a coming-of-age yarn, a knowing fairytale comedy, a gruesome yet screamingly camp thriller and a hokey-but-fun courtroom drama? Well, he did – and all in the first decade of his directing career.US audiences loved him first as an actor: he was the liberal son-in-law known as Meathead in nearly 200 episodes of the late-1970s sitcom All in the Family, based on the UK favourite Till Death Us Do Part. He remained in front of the camera for his 1984 directorial debut This Is Spinal Tap, which chronicled an entire band of meatheads. In fact, his face is the very first thing we see: he plays the ingratiating documentary-maker Marty DiBergi, an affectionate parody of Martin Scorsese as glimpsed in the off-stage scenes of The Last Waltz, his concert film about the Band. Spinal Tap’s chief target, though, was the speed with which fame can turn you dumb – or make idiots believe themselves to be geniuses. The heavy metal band, played by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer, put it best: “It’s such a fine line between stupid and clever.” Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Urs Fischer’s side are certain to begin 2026 bottom of the table but denied rampaging leaders victory at home Sometimes the numbers really don’t say it all. Mainz were on the wrong end of many of them as Sunday evening drew in, as you would expect for a visit of almost any team to the Allianz Arena, never mind a struggler. They had the lowest share of possession of any Bundesliga team in a game since the statistics were first recorded – 15%. When they did have the ball, fewer than 60% of their passes were actually completed. Are you sure you can face looking at the xG after that? Mainz logged a respectable 1.07, but Bayern Munich’s was a staggering 4.72.And yet, even if the most deflating statistical confirmation of all is that Mainz are certain to begin 2026 bottom of the table (even with a game still to play before Christmas), they have every right to feel good about themselves, even after conceding a late penalty equaliser to the inevitable Harry Kane. In Urs Fischer’s debut after being appointed as the new head coach Mainz became the first team to prevent Bayern from taking maximum points at home this season, and the first last-placed team to take a point at the venue since relegation-bound Köln in April 2006.

Pope Leo XIV privately urged organisers to convene the conference, the Guardian has learned.Forty-three women in Argentina say they were lured to Opus Dei schools as children and teenagers under promises of receiving an education. Instead, they say they were forced into working up to 12-hour days, cooking and cleaning for the elite male members, without pay. Continue reading...</p>

I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out.

                    <p class="content-text">Diary of a Wimpy Kid Ofcom has found Amazon Prime Video in breach of its UK on-demand rules after a customer renting Diary of a Wimpy Kid (rated PG by the British Board of Film Classification) was served a different title, Love & Other Drugs (15), containing strong sexual content. The regulator said the incident raised protection concerns for under-18s under ODPS Rule 12, which requires on-demand providers to take appropriate measures so specially restricted material is not normally seen or heard by children.  According to Ofcom, the mix-up was caused by a metadata error from a content partner, which supplied both films with the same unique identifier. Amazon said its systems flagged the clash, but it was manually overridden in error. The platform said the issue was escalated and fixed in under 48 hours, and it has since tightened processes and pushed partners to ensure unique identifiers are used across catalogues. Ofcom noted the title was rented/paid-for content (rather than included in Prime), and rentals are not available by default in children’s profiles. However, it said the error still risked exposing younger children because parents and carers would reasonably select a PG family film for unaccompanied viewing. Amazon said 122 customers attempted to access Diary of a Wimpy Kid during the period affected. Ofcom also criticised the speed of response when potential harm is ongoing, while acknowledging Amazon’s remedial steps.  The problem had surfaced publicly earlier in November when customer reports described the wrong film playing when selecting Diary of a Wimpy Kid.</p>

Amid all the noise, it’s difficult to know how bad this flu really is – and how much is political spin. I should start by saying “super flu” is not a scientific term or one used by any academics or clinicians I work with. It’s a colloquial phrase that’s been used by various NHS England bosses and taken up by Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Keir Starmer.This year, a couple of factors have come together to make it a harder flu season for hospitals to manage. First, flu has arrived earlier than previous years. This isn’t unique to the UK: it’s the same picture across the US, Canada, Japan, Germany – basically the northern hemisphere going into winter. This is in the context of multiple viruses circulating such as Covid and rhinoviruses, which means patients could be fighting one or more viruses at the same time and are more susceptible to getting sicker from influenza.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyond On Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.

And we have good reason to beDave Rich is director of policy at the Community Security TrustHeaton Park, Boulder, Washington DC – and now Bondi beach. Add the murders of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the UAE and Ziv Kipper, an Israeli-Canadian businessman, in Egypt, and Jews have been killed on five continents since the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas upended the Middle East and unleashed a wave of antisemitism around the world. Anti-Jewish terrorism is now a global problem, as is the hateful extremism that drives it.The death toll from the appalling atrocity in Sydney is shocking enough: at the time of writing, 15 people killed, including a child, and many more injured. Awful images circulate, as they always do. The mobile phone footage of two gunmen calmly taking aim at families enjoying a Hanukah party is utterly chilling. It takes a special kind of dehumanisation, an ideology of pure hatred and self-righteous conviction, to do that.Dave Rich is director of policy at the Community Security Trust and the author of Everyday Hate: How Antisemitism is Built into Our World – and How You Can Change itDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    <p class="content-text">BBC Studios is extending the reach of its digital and FAST portfolio across EMEA, adding new distribution for BBC Player and launching additional channels in Spain. BBC Player, the multi-genre VOD service that debuted on Movistar Plus+ in Spain in October, is now available via Vodafone Spain and Go Plc in Malta, offering up to 700 hours of BBC Studios programming spanning drama, natural history, documentaries, lifestyle and entertainment.  BBC Studios says BBC Player is now carried in 7 EMEA markets: Spain, Malta, Greece, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany and Poland, alongside other branded digital services including BBC Nordic+ and BBC NL+.  On the FAST side, BBC Studios last week launched 4 channels on MasOrange in Spain: Top Gear, BBC Series, BBC Earth and BBC Lifestyle.  The BBC Earth FAST channel is also due to extend to 5 additional platforms with existing partners across EMEA before the end of the year, building on its launch on Samsung TV Plus in the region in 2024.  Arran Tindall, President EMEA, Global Channels & Streaming, said the strategy is focused on accessibility and discovery across FAST, OTT and pay TV, pairing “rediscovery” brands such as Top Gear with curated VOD through BBC Player. </p>

Fresh off back-to-back Champions League defeats, albeit in controversial circumstances, and having lost four Serie A games in the first 14 rounds, his approach to criticism was bullish. “Despite what people say, in my view we are having a great season.

It has now been lovingly restored – with a thrillingly bolstered libraryIt is the place where Salvador Dalí painted The Enigma of Hitler, a haunting landscape featuring a giant telephone receiver that seems to be crying a tear over a cutout picture of the Fuhrer. Conceived in 1939, the work seems to anticipate war. It is also the place where Winston Churchill penned parts of his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, and painted its dappled-light view.

                    <p class="content-text">Nearly one-third of US streaming sign-ups recorded between February 2024 and January 2025 landed in the festive window from November to January, according to new research from Ampere Analysis. The study points to Black Friday as a major contributor, with 8 of the top 10 US streamers running promotional deals in 2024, offering savings ranging from $20 (€17) to $108 (€92). However, Ampere says promotions alone are not translating into stickier customers: only 3 services delivered stronger retention for subscribers acquired during the Black Friday period (24 November to 2 December) than those signing up at other points in the year. Instead, the research suggests deal mechanics matter. Higher-value discounts were linked to better long-term engagement, and offers running for more than 6 months consistently reduced churn. Price remains the pressure point. Ampere’s Q3 2025 consumer survey found 57% of US respondents cite cost as a key reason for cancelling, underlining the challenge of converting seasonal bargain-hunters into longer-term subscribers. Ampere research manager Olivia Deane said keeping festive sign-ups “requires a broader, more considered strategy” built around clear ongoing value as well as promotions.</p>

Turning her camera to the streets and taking us into artists’ studios, the film-maker captures the vibrant creative scene of the city. The turmoil of the protests against the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill, along with the draconian laws that followed, hangs heavy over every frame. In the midst of political turbulence, art emerges as a powerful, transformative tool of collective resistance.In an engaging and personable voiceover, Young weaves in stories from her own life growing up in Hong Kong as a rebellious teenager. Surrounded by bankers and financiers, she yearned to follow the footsteps of her film-making idols, such as Spike Lee, in the west. Her youthful disenchantment only makes Hong Kong Mixtape more moving as a hybrid of autobiography and documentary. We are introduced to a multitalented group of artists, but Young herself is also rediscovering what makes Hong Kong unique and culturally diverse, where activism and creativity go hand in hand. Alongside skilfully graffitied slogans, public electronic displays offer protest songs, raps and skits. Elsewhere, dance troupes create choreography out of banned gestures. Continue reading...</p>

But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banning TikTok, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.Congress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.Evelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law SchoolJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University Continue reading...</p>

You’ll be glad you didThis is my last column for you. I am shocked and delighted that I’ve been allowed to carry on for almost two years, saying such controversial and true things as: the oedipal complex is real and all of us have one; psychodynamic psychotherapy is an effective and vital mental health treatment and we must fight for it in the NHS; and Midnight Run is the best film of all time. It has been a joy and an honour, and, now we are here, I’ve been thinking about the significance of endings.Because they are significant. Sometimes, having no time left can make it possible to feel and say what was impossible before. They can invite an intimacy and truthfulness and grief that some find overwhelming. It’s not unusual for patients to talk of dropping out, or to skip the final session – to call it a waste of time, to want to leave the room before the end. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Yes, we love our roasties – but have we really explored the spud’s potential as a gift, an aesthetic, a mood?All I want for Christmas is … the Nairn Museum potato flask. Showcased as part of the Highland museum’s virtual Advent calendar on Instagram last week, it’s a late-18th-century Staffordshire pottery flask – to be filled with strong drink and used to toast a safe journey for a traveller – shaped like a very realistic, knobbly spud, complete with green bits. The benefactor who donated the flask apparently explained it was so ugly that no one in his family wanted to inherit it.More than 15,000 Instagram likers beg to differ, including me: I desperately covet this beauteous and useful tuber, surely the ideal emotional support accessory for the season’s more trying social engagements. As the museum’s representative explains, the potato was “seen as a very fashionable vegetable” back then, and I think we need to think hard about that: why isn’t it now? It might be the most valuable player on the Christmas dining table (don’t even think about arguing), but it’s cruelly taken for granted. Have we ever considered the potato as a gift, an aesthetic, a mood? Continue reading...</p>

He has deployed a massive military arsenal in and around the Caribbean Sea and taken a series of provocative actions off the Venezuelan coast, justifying it as necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.The Council on Foreign Relations says that deployment includes an “aircraft carrier, destroyers, cruisers, amphibious assault ships, and a special forces support ship. A variety of aircraft have also been active in the region, including bombers, fighters, drones, patrol planes, and support aircraft.” This is the largest display of American military might in the western hemisphere since we invaded Panama in 1989.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death Penalty Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Free OTT sports and entertainment network wedotv has expanded its distribution partnership with LG Channels, extending the availability of its FAST Channels to audiences in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Asia and Latin America. The move builds on an existing relationship between the two companies in Europe, where wedotv channels have been available on LG smart TVs since 2023. As part of the expansion, six FAST Channels are being rolled out across different regions, including wedotv movies, wedotv sports, wedotv cars, wedotv BIG stories, wedotv: Piel Salvaje and wedotv Get.Factual. The launches are tailored to local markets, with region-specific channel line-ups and subtitling. In the United Arab Emirates, LG Channels MENA has added wedotv BIG stories and wedotv sports, alongside two channels developed specifically for the region: wedotv cars and wedotv Get.Factual. All four channels are offered with Arabic subtitles. In Asia, LG TV owners in Singapore and Taiwan are set to gain access to wedotv movies and wedotv sports by the end of the year. These channels will be available with English, Malay and neutral Chinese subtitles. In Latin America, including Brazil, LG TV customers will receive a single IP FAST channel, wedotv amor: Piel Salvaje. The channel centres on the popular telenovela Piel Salvaje and will be available in both Portuguese and Spanish. “wedotv Channels have been available on LG Channels in Europe since 2023, so it is exciting that LG customers in MENA, Asia, and Latam/Brazil can now enjoy our regionally tailored content as well,” said Iza Piotrowska, Global Business Development Director at wedotv. “A large part of what makes wedotv successful is our ability to adapt and customise our channels – and even create entirely new channels – for the markets we serve.” Alongside the FAST Channel launches, wedotv has also extended its relationship with LG through LG Gallery+, the manufacturer’s subscription-based visual curation service. A curated selection of content from wedotv’s time2Rlx channel has been added to LG Gallery+, featuring 4K environmental and relaxation scenes such as landscapes, ocean waves and panoramic city views, accompanied by ambient soundscapes or gentle music. The time2Rlx content is now available on LG Gallery+ in South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom and across Europe.</p>

On the contrary: in the first half of this Dickensian foul-up, much of the pleasure comes from watching the company spring-load a very familiar crop of gags ready to explode after the break.Long-term Mischief watchers will guess, for example, that when a Maltesers box is dropped during rehearsals inside the model box for the Cornley Polytechnic Players’ A Christmas Carol, it will end up as a giant-sized component of the set. They will know that the rivalry between supercilious director Chris and bombastic actor Robert, fond of essaying the classics in the nude, will result in crazed feats of sabotage when the production gets under way. And they can be sure that dim-witted Dennis, who thinks he is auditioning for the role of “Frog Cratchit” after seeing the Muppets’ musical as research, will well and truly cook everyone’s goose.

Tommy Svensson’s team finally came unstuck against a Brazil side not only containing the wonderful Romário, but also Bebeto, Dunga, Jorginho and Raí. Brazil went on to win the World Cup, beating Italy on penalties in the final. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">German media company ProSiebenSat.1 has agreed to sell online weather portal wetter.com to Funke Mediengruppe, underlining its strategic focus on its core entertainment business while the publishing house is strengthening its digital portfolio. The transaction, structured as an asset deal, involves the sale of the wholly owned subsidiary from ProSiebenSat.1’s Commerce & Ventures segment. Around 100 employees will transfer to Funke as part of a transfer of operations. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal remains subject to antitrust approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026. ProSiebenSat.1 said the disposal forms part of its active portfolio management, allowing the group to sharpen its focus on entertainment while using the proceeds to improve its financial base and further reduce liabilities. The company co-founded wetter.com in 2000 as a media partner, acquired full ownership in 2014 and subsequently integrated the business into its digital division. Today, wetter.com is one of the two leading online weather portals in the German-speaking region and operates across 15 European markets under country-specific domains such as tiempo.es and weather24.com, with offices in Konstanz, Berlin and Munich. “With the successful sale of wetter.com, we are continuing to push ahead with the group’s strategic focus on its core entertainment business,” said Florian Hirschberger, CEO Commerce & Ventures at ProSiebenSat.1. “Over around ten years, ProSiebenSat.1 has developed wetter.com into an industry leader in the German-speaking region and made the brand widely known through TV advertising. I am pleased to know that the passionate team at wetter.com will continue to be in very good hands at Funke Digital. On behalf of ProSiebenSat.1, I would like to thank managing director Marius Neumann and his team for their successful work and wish the company every success under its new shareholder.” Stephan Thurm, Chief Digital Officer at Funke and a member of the Executive Board, described the deal as one of the group’s largest transactions in recent years. “The acquisition marks a significant milestone for Funke Digital,” he said. “Weather information has been one of the most popular topics on our online portals for years, so this new offering is a perfect fit for our portfolio. It also enriches our journalistic brands.” According to Funke, wetter.com reaches an average of more than 25 million users and generates over 800 million page views per month, supported by a rapidly growing social media presence across platforms including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. The publisher plans to integrate premium features from wetter.com as added value for its digital subscribers, further diversifying its revenue streams. The takeover of wetter.com is Funke’s ninth acquisition this year, following purchases including praktischArzt, Medi-Karriere, everbay, Gala, Brigitte, Eltern, Chefkoch and Kitchen Stories.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">I went from selling flats in Paris to being alone in a cabin in Guinea looking after primates. It changed my life, but one relationship marked me like no otherIn 2022, I had a job at an estate agents in Paris selling ridiculously expensive flats, and decided I needed to do something more meaningful with my life. I resigned, and six months later arrived in Guinea.In hindsight I was a young kid, full of anger, not happy with his life. That 26-year-old is definitely not me now – and it was living with primates that changed my life. Continue reading...</p>

It’s true whether you’re looking at the world from the perspective of a frustrated and talented teenage girl, or from that of a megalomaniacal rogue AI who dreams of blasting every human on Earth into space in tiny hexagonal pods (with free wifi!). Such is the chaotic and sensational combination of styles that fuels animated road-trip riot The Mitchells vs the Machines, a film that crams a father-daughter conflict, a techno-apocalypse, Olivia Colman, and every colour of the rainbow into a burnt-orange 1993 station wagon.Phil Lord and Christopher Miller produce with the same kind of free-spirited approach that characterised the likes of The Lego Movie and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It’s then balanced out by Gravity Falls’ Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe, who complement the zaniness with a nuanced, gentle and heartfelt story, making it more than just a superficial display of artistry. The Mitchells vs the Machines is not just a story of the relationships people have with one another, but those we have with technology and our past selves. Continue reading...</p>

In the shadow of the Peacock theater in Los Angeles and next to a giant, demonic statue promoting new game Divinity, which would be announced on stage later that evening, stands a collection of people in bright red shirts. Many are holding signs: a tombstone honouring the “death” of The Game Awards’ Future Class talent development programme; a bold, black-and-red graphic that reads “We’re Done Playing”; and “wanted” posters for Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick and Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer. This is a protest.The protesters, who were almost denied entry to the public space outside the Peacock theater (“they knew we were coming,” one jokes), are from United Videogame Workers (UVW), an industry-wide, direct-join union for North America that is part of the Communications Workers of America. “We are out here today to raise awareness of the plight of the game worker,” says Anna C Webster, chair of the freelancing committee, in the hot Los Angeles sun. “Our industry has been strip-mined for resources by these corporate overlords, and we figured the best place to raise awareness of what’s happening in the games industry is at the culmination, the final boss, as it were: The Game Awards.” Continue reading...</p>

But leaving her a voice note every day has increased my productivity, and deepened our friendship When my friend Rosamund suggested we try a productivity technique of leaving each other a voice note every day, I immediately said yes – even if I suspected, deep down, that we might not keep it up for long. I was circumspect because we both lead busy lives, 3,500 miles apart. She lives in London and I’m based in Brooklyn. It is hard to keep in touch sometimes. Even talking on the phone feels tough, what with the time difference and our schedules. Adding another thing to do every day, even a small, two-minute task, felt like a challenge.The technique is simple enough. You send a friend a voice note in the morning saying what you “did” that day. You always speak in the past tense for accountability. The theory is that once you tell a friend you have “done” something, you will be more likely to follow it through. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The Welsh author vividly captures the solitude, hard labour, dramas and dangers of rural lifeIn these six stories of human frailty and responsibility, Welsh writer Cynan Jones explores the imperatives of love and the labour of making and sustaining lives. Each is told with a compelling immediacy and intensity, and with the quality of returning to a memory.In the story Reindeer a man is seeking a bear, which has been woken by hunger from hibernation and is now raiding livestock from the farms of a small isolated community. “There was no true sunshine. There was no gleam in the snow, but the lateness of the left daylight put a cold faint blue through the slopes.” The story’s world is one in which skill, endurance, even stubbornness might be insufficient to succeed, but are just enough to persist.

                    <p class="content-text">The storytelling is brittle, but there is still enjoyment to be had from this story of a mother and child and rescue from a catastrophic flood in SeoulKim Byung-woo’s chimeric but not unenjoyable sixth feature begins like a normal apocalypse movie, with a deluge inundating Seoul. Then it flirts with taking on social stratification baggage as a beleaguered mother tries to climb up her 30-storey apartment block to escape the rising flood waters. But once it is revealed that An-na (Kim Da-mi) is a second-ranking science officer for an indispensable research project, the film becomes a different beast entirely – possibly something quite insidious.As the film gats under way, An-na’s swimming-obsessed six-year-old son Ja-in (Kwon Eun-seong) sees his dreams come true when water begins flooding their apartment. Along with everyone else, they begin pounding the stairs – before corporate security officer Hee-jo (Park Hae-soo) catches up with them and explains that an asteroid impact in Antarctica is causing catastrophic rains that will end civilisation. But a helicopter is en route to evacuate her and Ja-in, because she is one of the pioneering minds who have been at work in a secret UN lab that holds the key to humanity’s future.

With temperatures expected to continue soaring above 40C (104F) over the coming days, the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe heatwave warning across much of the south-west.The conditions follow bushfires in New South Wales this month, which resulted in the destruction of homes and loss of life. Severe heatwave warnings have also been issued for later this week in parts of South Australia and New South Wales, as a ridge of high pressure moves eastward, bringing blazing sunshine to much of the region.

The 85-year-old singer said his cancer had “gone at the moment” and backed calls for a national screening test for men.In an interview with Good Morning Britain, he said: “I don’t know whether it’s going to come back. We can’t tell those sort of things but we need to – absolutely. I’m convinced: get there, get tested, get checked.” Continue reading...</p>

But viewing 3D scans that show how people’s feet look while standing in their shoes changed his mind completely.He took two scans of a person’s feet – one barefoot and one in high heels – and the difference was striking. In the high heels, the toes were crowded together, the big toe showed a bunion, and the smaller toes were clawed, gripping for balance. Continue reading...</p>

The Arsenal manager was even teed up to do so with a generous question in the press conference that followed his side’s 2-1 win against Wolves on Saturday. Had his team shown the toughness of champions by recovering from a 90th-minute concession to steal all three points? “That’s something very positive but I don’t put it down to resilience,” Arteta replied. It was of a piece with him essentially reading the riot act to his players. They had not turned up at the start, he suggested, and the less said about the closing stages, the better – apart from the last-gasp winner. It is rare to hear Arteta be so critical but he knew his team had got away with one and he wanted them to know, too. Arsenal have a rare blank midweek before they go to Everton for another 8pm kick-off next Saturday. The standards must be higher.

To further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by all the processes and fulfillments of art – this is one of the fascinating challenges of these days.” Those are the words of John F Kennedy, after whom the US’s national performing arts centre is named. The impulse to build it came from Dwight D Eisenhower; it was given JFK’s name after his assassination; and it opened in 1971, to the music of Leonard Bernstein and the choreography of Alvin Ailey, in the presidency of Richard Nixon. The Kennedy Centre, in short, was designed to be bipartisan, a place of gathering for Democrats and Republicans alike, a proud showcase of the best of America’s dance, opera and music.For 50 years it carefully trod that line, its board balanced by members of Congress from both sides of the political divide. But it turns out it can take just months to unravel half a century of high-minded purpose.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writer Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Who’s that daring young farmyard animal on the flying trapeze? The creatures of Mossy Bottom have been put on stage by ‘edgy’ circus stars Circa – but the burlesque shearing had to go‘It’s a family drama,” says Yaron Lifschitz. “It’s kind of a minor key, gently comic version of the Oresteian trilogy. Without the dismemberment and murder and purple carpets.” Lifschitz is talking about his latest production for Circa, the acclaimed Australian contemporary circus group. Is it a Greek epic? A state-of-the-nation drama? A searing emotional journey? Nope, none of those. It’s a fun, family circus show based on that cheeky cartoon character Shaun the Sheep.You might not think the antics of an anthropomorphic flock of farm animals can be compared to Aeschylus, but Lifschitz sees characters bound together as family with different personalities, friends and enemies, having to work out how to live together. Shaun the Sheep has been a huge success since the character originated in Wallace & Gromit: A Close Shave in 1995. The stop-motion series launched in 2007 has been broadcast in more than 50 countries, and had multiple spin-offs including two feature films and another one in the pipeline. Continue reading...</p>

Was Hollywood’s most annoying actor going to go for broke in what promised to be the most irritating film of all time? Well I am here to hold up my hand and say that first impressions couldn’t have been more wrong. Marty Supreme is one of the most exciting, indeed sensational films of the year, and if the Guardian film critics’ poll wasn’t a democracy, many of us would made it No 1 by some distance.For it turns out that Marty Supreme is a character drama of quite remarkable richness, its excitement and sensation deriving from the nervous energy of its protagonist – who is indeed a ping pong player called Marty – but plying his trade in the decidedly non-quirky early 1950s where our hero, played by Chalamet, is essentially trying to use this non-traditional sport to plot a way out of the dullness and grind of his normie life, where he is on track to become a manager of a shoe store. Marty (whose last name is not actually Supreme, but the amusingly alliterative Mauser) is a pretty dislikable individual: happy to abandon a girl he gets pregnant, throw a fit when he loses a match, and think he can talk his way out of any kind of difficulty. But such is his verve, charisma and never-say-die attitude, he carries you with him. Continue reading...</p>

Barry-Murphy was in charge of Manchester City’s under-21s on the evening when Palmer – fresh from replacing Bernardo Silva as an 89th-minute substitute in a 2-0 Premier League win against Burnley – strolled across the bridge at the Etihad Campus and reported for duty at the academy stadium, scoring a sensational hat-trick in a 5-0 victory over Leicester.It is a story Barry-Murphy, now in charge of the League One leaders, Cardiff, recounts given Palmer could be in the opposition team when Chelsea visit in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday. “He said to Pep [Guardiola] and [his former assistant] Rodolfo Borrell the day before the game: ‘There’s an under-21 game tomorrow night, if I don’t get on, can I play?’” Barry-Murphy says with a smile.

Hitting the road with her one-legged doll Bella for company, Lek has only a strong moral compass to guide her to the new home she is promised by her mum’s ghost. A number of picaresque companions put it to the test, including a spoiled rich girl (Kathaya Chongprasith) desperate for a friend and a quack doctor (Adam Kaokept) hawking dodgy cure-alls.

Chance decreed that in a Halifax bookshop Britten would buy a copy of Gerald Bullett’s collection, The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems, the mystical and evocative aura of some of the earliest texts immediately inspiring him – unfazed by U-boat activity – to set them to harp accompaniment. This element of serendipity in the emergence of A Ceremony of Carols, with its iconic evoking of medieval sensibilities and faith, perhaps helps define its enduring appeal.Using the arrangement for mixed choir by composer/conductor Julius Harrison, the Britten was the focus of the Cardiff Polyphonic Choir’s Christmas celebration, under their conductor Thomas Blunt. Clearly, this was not the bright sheen of boys’ voices with which we’re more familiar, but the atmosphere and dramatic flow of the 11 movements was there, from the sopranos’ opening plainchant to the fading Alleluia in the final Recession. In the central carol, This Little Babe, the words of the 16th-century Catholic martyr Robert Southwell depict the Christ child as an angel come to avenge Satan: Blunt set a pace that allowed the fast, furious, rhythms to realise a wonderful momentum, the voices’ tight imitations then building tension towards the emphatic climax. The energy of this, together with the penultimate Deo Gracias, captured well the contrast with the radiant, lilting beauty of There Is No Rose and Balulalow, Elen Hydref’s harp playing always expressive.

Not escaping for Christmas, but avoiding it altogether – the stressful buildup, consumer chaos, panic buying, the enforced jollity and parties. When the first festive gifts start appearing in the shops in September, it’s time to confirm my travel plans, ideally to include New Year’s Eve as well.Sometimes I travel independently, but more often in a group, and while it’s not always possible to avoid the tinsel and baubles – even in non-Christian countries thousands of miles away – I just relish not being at home at this time of year.

                    <p class="content-text">Correspondence between the Lord of the Flies author and his editor reveals one of the great literary collaborations of the ageWhen William Golding submitted Lord of the Flies to Faber in 1953 it had already been rejected at least seven times, maybe as many as 20. Charles Monteith could tell from the dog-eared typescript that it had done the rounds, and a reader for Faber called it “absurd and uninteresting … Rubbish and dull. Pointless.” But Monteith, young and new to the job, could see the book’s potential, and suggested ways that Golding – then a Salisbury-based schoolmaster in his early 40s – might improve it. More radically cut and revised than Monteith expected, the novel became a school syllabus classic. Thus began an author-editor friendship that lasted 40 years.Their early exchanges by post were formal in the extreme: it took two years for Dear Monteith, Dear Golding to become Dear Charles, Dear Bill. But as provincial grammar school boys who both read English at Oxford, the two were attuned to each other. And after the rescue act performed on his first novel, Golding remained humbly grateful for whatever help he could get: “I’m in your hands as usual. I’ve no particular feeling of possession over the book.” Monteith’s touch was gentle for the next few years: enthusiastic, even effusive, he reassured Golding that his drafts of The Inheritors and Free Fall were the finished product. With later novels, such as The Spire and Rites of Passage, editorial feedback was tougher and more extensive. But there were no fallings out. “I’ve always had a feeling of you there, present but not breathing down my neck!” Golding said. He never seriously considered moving to another publishing house.

                    <p class="content-text">Revolution is still being sought three decades after the landmark free-transfer ruling with a Dutch lawyer calling for a collective bargaining agreement for playersOn 15 December 1995, judges at the European court of justice (CJEU) took two minutes to bring an end to a legal process that had lasted five years. The Bosman rule, as it was known, was to stand, the judges said. European football clubs were no longer allowed to demand transfer fees for players whose contracts had expired, with governing bodies stopped from capping the number of Europeans in any team. The man whose dogged legal pursuit had brought about these changes, Jean‑Marc Bosman, emerged from a crowd of cameras and well‑wishers to give his verdict. “I have got to the top of the mountain and I am now very tired,” he said.For Bosman himself, it was downhill from there. “In the past I got a lot of promises but never received anything,” he told the Observer in 2015, claiming he “earned nothing” from the changes that ensued. He went bankrupt, was treated for alcoholism and was found guilty of assault against his then partner in 2013, resulting in a community service order that included mowing the grass of his local football pitch. There can be no argument, however, that the ruling that took his name was historic and, 30 years on, it has helped bring about a revolution in the sport from which the man himself was ultimately shunned.

Whether it’s telling his neighbours they needn’t worry about a spate of burglaries because “nobody’ll target your place – they’ll want stuff they can actually sell”, or sharing the secrets of his Tinder success: “You have a chat: ‘How are you?

                    <p class="content-text">He wrote poems named after Kylie songs and named his collection of erotic fiction after her indie album. He even loved the B-sides. So what did the avant garde writer find so inspiring about the mini Melbourne marvel? Kevin Killian was obsessed with stars. Not in a metaphysical sense, like the grand lineage of poets that went before him, but the celebrity kind. Some were A-listers – he kept a vast database on Julia Roberts – and some more obscure. In 2000, taken by the work of cult literary sensation JT LeRoy, and confusion about their identity, Killian gave public readings of their work in San Francisco, where he had lived for 20 years after moving from New York. He would also turn unknown poets into local celebrities, hosting poetry events and making rapturous introductions to crowds that were occasionally outnumbered by the people on stage. “Anyone he admired was an A-lister,” says poet and friend, Evan Kennedy, “especially unknown poets. He’d enthuse about someone, and I’d say ‘Who?’ Kevin engaged the Bay Area poetry scene like Warhol did his Factory – but unlike Warhol, it wasn’t centred around him or his work.”Killian – a figure in San Francisco’s New Narrative movement, alongside writers such as Kathy Acker and Robert Glück – saved his biggest celebrity obsession, however, for Kylie Minogue. She ran through his work like letters in a stick of rock. In 2008, he published Action Kylie, a poetry collection that included works named after Kylie songs (Slow, Spinning Around, Your Disco Needs You), and more abstract scenarios, such as the lovelorn An Audience with Kylie Minogue, in which lyrics from Fever intertwine with the mundanity of Love Hearts sweets. A year later, in 2009, Killian published Impossible Princess, an award-winning collection of gay erotic fiction named after Kylie’s misunderstood 1997 opus. She’d crop up elsewhere too, reflecting Killian’s bonafides as a proper fan. Tightrope, from 2014’s Tweaky Village collection, is named after a Kylie B-side, and highlights how “All her best songs saved as B-sides or just leaked on to the internet, where they live on as fan favourites”.

                    <p class="content-text">After weeks of allegations of schoolboy racism, the Reform leader is doubling down. And our political establishment is allowing itJust as I was starting to write this column, an email alert popped up on my screen. “Punters back Nigel for prime minister after Keir Starmer,” it read, placing the Reform leader second in the odds market after Wes Streeting. What a weird, dissonant duality this is. Nigel Farage is in his fourth week of revelations about alleged racist behaviour at school, and yet, here we are. This is one of those twilight-zone moments in British politics, where it seems something is going to “cut through” any minute now. For a moment it seems as if it absolutely will. And then, there’s a loss of momentum and a return to the status quo. In my mind it manifests like a battle of physical forces, acting on one another. Journalistic investigations, testimonies, whistleblowers, all as a sort of storm that blows on a political actor who may be knocked off his feet, but still manages to cling on by his fingernails, until the gale blows over.Up scrambles Farage, a few pieces and more than a few polling points knocked off him, but still in place. This is, so far, what he is managing to survive – the testimonies of some 28 of Farage’s contemporaries at Dulwich college who have told the Guardian that they experienced or witnessed racist or antisemitic behaviour when he was a teenager. Jewish students were taunted; “gas them,” Farage said, “Hitler was right”. A black student, much younger than the then 17-year-old Farage, was told: “That’s the way back to Africa.” The allegations amount, in my reading, to a sort of obsessive campaign against minority students, pursued with the kind of bewildering commitment that anyone who has ever been bullied will feel in their bones.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...</p>

The disclosure, made at a hastily convened late night news conference, represents a stunning turn of events in an investigation into killings that rattled the Ivy League campus, and came more than 12 hours after officials had announced that they had taken a person into custody.The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said of the man who was detained earlier, there is “no basis to consider him a person of interest.” Continue reading...</p>

The wide path to the top of Gibbet Hill, with views of Wheal Betsy, the nearby abandoned mine, is glazed with puddles, and I am forced to hop between tussocks of sedge to avoid treading ankle-deep in the liquid earth.This is my favourite season on Dartmoor – a time when it most feels like a moor: wet, muddy, bleak, empty.

As the show hits China, Australia and Mexico, its ‘nerd’ creators explain how they went global with a box of hats and a dreamNatasha Hodgson is wondering what to make of all the straight women who have developed a crush on her. Or, to put it more accurately, all the straight women who have developed a crush on her when she’s dressed as a second world war naval intelligence officer and speaking in a silly voice. But is it really Hodgson these woman have fallen for? Or is it Ewen Montagu, the bombastic, braces-wearing war hero she plays in the hit musical Operation Mincemeat?“The confusion is real,” says Hodgson. “These women come to the show believing themselves to be straight, then they have a total identity crisis. But hey – if that’s not what musical theatre is for, I don’t know what is!” Continue reading...</p>

You don’t have to be related to Hudson to consider her a joyous proposition – a great performer who hasn’t yet made a great film. It was a quarter-century ago in Almost Famous, her breakthrough picture, that she first proved she could hoist a movie out of the doldrums while making the task appear as effortless as blow-drying her hair. Without her performance as Penny Lane, the rock’n’roll muse who describes herself as a “band-aid” rather than a groupie, Cameron Crowe’s dopey valentine to the 1970s of his youth would have been Almost Forgettable.

Not because the world needed permission to enjoy pizza – it clearly didn’t – but because the news soothed a longstanding national irritation: France and Japan, recognised in 2010 and 2013, had beaten us to it. For Italy’s culinary patriots, this had become a psychological pebble in the shoe: a tiny, persistent reminder that someone else had been validated first.Yet the strength of Italian cuisine has never rested on an ancient, coherent culinary canon. Most of what passes for ancient “regional tradition” was assembled in the late 20th century, largely for tourism and domestic reassurance. The real history of Italian food is turbulent: a saga of hunger, improvisation, migration, industrialisation and sheer survival instinct. It is not a serene lineage of grandmothers, sunlit tables and recipes carved in marble. It is closer to a national long-distance sprint from starvation – not quite the imagery Italy chose to present to Unesco.Alberto Grandi is the author of La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste and a professor of food history at the University of Parma Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">It’s natural to want information about a traumatic event but graphic imagery can cause a significant stress responseWhat we know about the Bondi terror attackLike everyone else, I watched news of the Bondi attack unfold last night with shock, horror and dismay. As I did so, I was immediately assailed by imagery of bodies lying on the ground, barely hidden from view. I closed these videos immediately, knowing the way this imagery can stick in one’s mind.When terrible events such as yesterday’s attackoccur, we often race to find out as much as possible about what happened. We do so by trawling social media and news sites. This is a natural way of making sense of events, and reflects a human urge to know what is occurring around us in order to keep us safe. Sometimes it’s a more prurient interest, like the way we slow down to look at a crash.Dr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

                    <p class="content-text">Music Box Group is accelerating its expansion in the German market with the launch of five new music television channels. The new services are being carried first by TV streaming service waipu.tv, joining Music Box Classic which has been part of the line-up for several months. From 15 December 2025, waipu.tv subscribers gain access to Music Box Hits and Music Box Dance. Three further channels – Music Box 80s, Music Box 90s and Music Box 00s – will launch exclusively on the platform, all offered in Full HD. The services are designed to address different musical tastes and generations, ranging from current chart hits and electronic dance music to curated selections from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Music Box Classic continues to focus on pop and rock favourites from multiple decades and remains part of the waipu.tv line-up. With these additions, Music Box significantly broadens its reach in Germany and positions waipu.tv as the platform with the most extensive Music Box offering in the market. “The German audience traditionally has a strong musical taste and high expectations of music television. Together with waipu.tv, we can offer a diverse channel portfolio that is specifically tailored to viewers’ needs – from brand new hits to nostalgic memories of past decades,” said Serge Kobel, Managing Director of the Music Box Group. Michael Marberg, Head of New-TV Partnerships at Exaring, operator of waipu.tv, added: “Our music TV portfolio is the largest of its kind in Germany. Its diversity is what makes it so valuable for our viewers. Music television offers a curated experience that many people consciously enjoy. With the new, exclusive Music Box channels, we are expanding our offer and creating even more choice for everyone who appreciates high-quality music programming.” Music Box is one of Europe’s longest-established music television brands, having first launched in the UK in 1984, ahead of MTV Europe and later national music channels such as MCM in France, VIVA in Germany and VH1 UK. While the brand originated in the UK, its development since the 2000s has been primarily focused on Central and Eastern Europe, where it has built a strong distribution footprint. Today, Music Box Group operates as a dedicated music television company headquartered in Warsaw, with an additional office in Prague. The group runs a portfolio of 24/7 linear music channels distributed across multiple business models, including traditional ad-funded linear TV, Pay-TV and FAST. Its channels are currently available in markets including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine and Germany, with further European expansion planned for 2026. A key differentiator for Music Box is its extensive content library of more than 20,000 music videos spanning several decades. The group uses proprietary upscaling technology to deliver older standard-definition videos in Full HD, ensuring consistent picture quality across its channels. All playlists are curated by human music editors, with the company deliberately avoiding algorithm-driven programming in favour of an editorial approach that emphasises musical context, emotional flow and time-of-day relevance. The German expansion is part of a broader strategic realignment undertaken by Music Box Group in 2025. In May, the company established a new legal entity in Prague to centralise broadcasting operations and enable the launch of new thematic channels under EU regulation. By December, the Czech media regulator RRTV had granted seven new broadcasting licences to the group, replacing earlier arrangements under Gibraltar-based licences. Several of the newly licensed channels have already launched in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Germany, with further roll-outs planned in Poland, Estonia and Lithuania The company has stressed that the development of these new channels was planned well before Paramount’s decision to withdraw MTV-branded channels from several European markets, underlining that Music Box’s German expansion reflects a long-term strategy rather than a reaction to recent market changes.</p>
