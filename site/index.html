Members of the Confederation of African Football’s (Caf) executive committee, along with various other dignitaries including George Weah, the former Ballon d’Or winner and president of Liberia at the time, were assembled in Rabat at a seminar to hear Gianni Infantino outline his plan for the development of competitions and infrastructure in African football.As well as improving standards in refereeing and mobilising investment in the continent’s infrastructure, the president of Fifa floated the prospect of holding its most important tournament, the Africa Cup of Nations, every four years instead of every two and described the current arrangement as “useless”. The argument ran that it would be more beneficial for countries “at the commercial level” and would help to “project African football to the top of the world”. “Let us show the world what we can do,” added Infantino. “This day is special – it’s the start of a new chapter for African football.” Continue reading...</p>

In a building across the way, Zvonimir Boban is explaining what brought him back. We are eating squid ink risotto in one corner of a room now configured as Dinamo Zagreb’s canteen; diagonally opposite is the spot where, fighting through the club’s youth system, a young arrival from Dalmatia used to sleep. “Emotionally it’s the biggest story of my life, this one,” Boban says, memories of this former dormitory leaping into his mind’s eye. “Where, if not here?”He has, in some shape or form, been almost everywhere else. Boban has burned brightly but briefly in each of his various lives as a football administrator. The sport would look different were it not for his influence in senior roles at Fifa and Uefa across the past decade. Almost two years have passed since his high-profile resignation from the latter and there was always the sense Boban, opinionated and deeply principled, had further rungs to climb.

                    <p class="content-text">Executed with trademark technical flair and empathy, this part-horror, part-fairytale set in a haunted orphanage from 2001 is one of the director’s bestHe’s a household name now after The Shape of Water and his new Frankenstein, but 25 years ago Guillermo del Toro was a virtual unknown, still bruised from the Harvey Weinstein-produced Hollywood flop Mimic. But, as this overlooked follow-up attests, he was always a class act. In fact, this is one of his best: a rich, rousing ghost story shrouded in trademark gothic gloom but executed with technical flair and a good deal of empathy.As with his later breakthrough Pan’s Labyrinth, it’s part-horror, part-fairytale, with children at its centre. The setting is a middle-of-nowhere boys’ orphanage in 1930s Spain, a leftist sanctuary from Franco’s fascists during the civil war. Newcomer Carlos (Fernando Tielve) must find his feet in this semi-surreal realm, with an unexploded bomb in the middle of the courtyard, some kindly adults (one-legged Marisa Paredes and kindly doctor Federico Luppi), some not-so-kindly adults (aggressive caretaker Eduardo Noriega), and junior bullies to win over. There’s also a ghost in the mix: a pale-faced boy named Santi, whose death no one seems to want to discuss, and to whose empty bed Carlos is ominously assigned. Continue reading...</p>

Leading an ensemble of three drummers, Korwar develops a dense percussive language throughout the record’s 10 movements, channelling Steve Reich’s phasing motifs as well as Indian classical phrasing and anchoring each in the repetition of a continual, thrumming refrain. As the album continues, the refrain begins to emulate the hypnotic repetition of ceremonial rhythm, drawing us further into Korwar’s percussive world the longer we listen. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Exclusive: Campaigners say slashing overseas aid would leave UK unable to meet existing commitmentsPlans by Reform UK to slash the aid budget by 90% would not cover existing contributions to global bodies such as the UN and World Bank, shredding Britain’s international influence and risking its standing within those organisations, charities and other parties have warned.Under cuts announced by Nigel Farage in November, overseas aid would be capped at £1bn a year, or about 0.03% of GDP. Keir Starmer’s government is already set to reduce aid from 0.5% of GDP to 0.3% by 2027, but even that lower proportion would still amount to £9bn a year. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The Harvard professor provides a ceaseless flow of startling details in this exhaustively researched, 1000-year account In the early 17th century, the Peruvian city of Potosí billed itself as the “treasure of the world” and “envy of kings”. Sprouting at the foot of the Cerro Rico, South America’s most populous settlement produced 60% of the world’s silver, which not only enabled Spain to wage its wars and service its debts, but also accelerated the economic development of India and China. The city’s wealthy elites could enjoy crystal from Venice and diamonds from Ceylon while one in four of its mostly indigenous miners perished. Cerro Rico became known as “the mountain that eats men”.The story of Potosí, in what is now southern Bolivia, contains the core elements of Sven Beckert’s mammoth history of capitalism: extravagant wealth, immense suffering, complex international networks, a world transformed. The Eurocentric version of capitalism’s history holds that it grew out of democracy, free markets, Enlightenment values and the Protestant work ethic. Beckert, a Harvard history professor and author of 2015’s prize-winning Empire of Cotton, assembles a much more expansive narrative, spanning the entire globe and close to a millennium. Like its subject, the book has a “tendency to grow, flow, and permeate all areas of activity”. Fredric Jameson famously said that it was easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. At times during these 1,100 pages, I found it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism. Continue reading...</p>

The retired teacher was sweeping his metal detector across a hillside in Leicestershire’s Welland valley when a series of beeps brought him up short. Digging down, he found a cache of buried coins almost two millennia old. He had chanced upon one of the UK’s most important iron age hoards, totalling about 5,000 silver and gold coins.More than 25 years on, I’m staring at Ken’s find at the civic museum in the nearby town of Market Harborough. The now gleaming coins are decorated with wreaths and horses. They’re about the size of 5p pieces, but speak of a wild-eyed age of tribal lands and windswept hill forts. Continue reading...</p>

The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and riskIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.ChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...</p>

But rather than becoming a Holmes and Watson of the supernatural dimension, they embarked on a bitterly fought contest to be the first to vanquish the vampire, each undermining the other man’s authority along the way.

                    <p class="content-text">Liberal democracies view Putin’s Russia as a bully – and Trump’s US as an angry drunk with a bazooka. The response is pure venom There are people who argue that Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine is not motivated by fears or imperial ambitions, but by other countries’ disrespect. Russia once commanded authority as one of the world’s two superpowers, but it has since forfeited that status. It knows it has lost the respect of other countries (Barack Obama famously dismissed Russia as just a “regional power”), and the Ukraine war is its way of winning it back.What is perhaps surprising is that Donald Trump’s turn against Europe has similar motivations. Putin knows his aggressive revanchism won’t win Russia any love among countries whose respect he craves. But if he can’t be loved, he hopes at least to be feared. If you are in a social order that regards you as inferior, you have every incentive to turn spoiler.Henry Farrell is the Stavros Niarchos Foundation professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University.

Cue plot twists and months of public intrigueOn 16 July 2025, Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot went to a Coldplay concert in Boston. You know this, I know this, my pop-culture-averse neighbour Norma knows this.

My wife, Elvira, and daughter Caroline had moved to a small town in the countryside a few years earlier, and I planned in due course to join the festivities permanently.I’d made the trip before, once or twice a year since they moved, mainly to get the lay of the land. But this time was different. Caroline had recently had her first child and our first grandchild. And now, after making do with photos and videos, I was finally going to meet Lucia Antonia, all of 11 weeks old. Rarely in my life had I felt more giddy about an encounter in the offing.

An earlier overnight attack hit port and energy infrastructure in the Odesa region, causing a fire at a major port and disrupting electricity supplies to tens of thousands of people. “Russia is attempting to disrupt maritime logistics by launching systematic attacks on port and energy infrastructure,” deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on Telegram.A Russian general was killed after an explosive device detonated beneath his car in what Moscow described as a likely assassination carried out by Ukrainian intelligence services, reports Pjotr Sauer. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, head of the operational training directorate of the Russian armed forces’ general staff, died of his injuries, a spokesperson for Russia’s investigative committee said. “Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder.” Russian Telegram channels with links to the security services reported that Sarvarov’s car exploded while driving along a Moscow street about 7am on Monday. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack.Donald Trump has said talks to end the Ukraine war are going “OK”, a day after his envoy Steve Witkoff characterised US discussions with Ukrainian and European representatives in Florida as “productive and constructive”. “The talks are going along,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday. “We are talking. It’s going OK.” Asked if he planned to speak to Volodymyr Zelenskyy or Vladimir Putin, Trump didn’t say, offering only of the fighting: “I’d like to see it stopped.”Zelenskyy said initial drafts of US proposals for a peace deal met many of Kyiv’s demands but suggested neither side in the war was likely to get everything it wanted in talks on a settlement. “Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian president said on Monday of the latest talks with US officials. “There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either.” Trump has been pushing for a peace deal for months but has run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.Moscow said parallel talks between Russia and the US in Miami at the weekend should not be seen as a breakthrough. “This is a working process,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said when asked whether the talks could be seen as a turning point. The Izvestia news outlet cited him as saying in remarks published on Tuesday that discussions were expected to continue in a “meticulous” format and that Russia’s priority was to obtain from the US details of Washington’s work with Europeans and Ukrainians on a possible settlement. He said Moscow would then judge how far those ideas matched what he called the “spirit of Anchorage”, after the Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska in August.Zelenskyy has said residents of a border village taken into Russia by Moscow’s troops had interacted with their neighbours for years without incident. The Ukrainian president on Monday confirmed media reports that residents of Hrabovske village – on the Sumy region’s border and home to 52 people – were taken away by Russian troops. “I think they simply didn’t expect Russian troops to simply walk in and take them away as prisoners,” Zelenskyy said. “But that’s what happened.” The Kremlin has not commented on the situation. The Ukrainian army has said it is battling an attempted Russian breakthrough in the north-eastern Ukrainian region, where Russian forces have recently seized several villages near the border.

It’s relentlessly charming – and hugely moving when they talk about Dame Judi’s late husbandCast your mind back to Christmas 2017, and you might remember a slightly wacky BBC documentary called Dame Judi Dench: My Passion for Trees. On the surface, it seemed like one of those god-awful shows put together by tombola; matching a celebrity with a random subject and hoping it would pass muster.However, this was not the case. Dame Judi Dench, it turned out, really did have a passion for trees. An obsessive passion, one that manifested itself in a small woodland where she named trees after friends of hers who had died. The result was unexpectedly tender and gorgeous, and the show ended up being the best thing on TV that Christmas. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">German video ad sales house Goldvertise will move to High View at the turn of the year, as parent Goldbach continues to streamline its portfolio and refocus on Switzerland. Goldbach Group, the Swiss ad sales company owned by TX Group, has agreed to sell its German subsidiary Goldvertise Media to Bavaria-based media group High View, with the transaction taking effect at the turn of the year 2025/26. Under the deal, High View will acquire 100% of Goldvertise, which was only established at the end of 2024 following the separation of Goldbach’s German activities. Both parties said Goldvertise will continue to operate as an independent company within the High View group, with managing director Frank Möbius remaining in charge. The acquisition follows Goldbach’s broader clean-up of its portfolio. Earlier this month, the company sold its advertising technology unit Splicky to Danish media buying platform Adform, and has stated it is increasingly concentrating on its Swiss core market. For High View, which is headquartered in Landshut and is best known as an operator of thematic TV channels in the DACH region, the purchase is positioned as a move to strengthen its ambitions in video advertising spanning linear TV, connected TV and online video. High View operates brands including Deluxe Music and a number of entertainment channels, and intends to further expand integrated sales across its portfolio after the transaction closes. “Goldvertise and High View have been closely and successfully partnered for many years. Through the future collaboration we can link our brands, capabilities and technologies even more closely and use synergies in a targeted way – to the benefit of all our partners, clients and advertising customers,” said Möbius. Goldvertise markets advertising inventory across connected TV, linear TV and online video. The company works with more than 45 special-interest TV channels, including pay-TV and AGF-measured offerings, and has been building its CTV inventory with an emphasis on owned-and-operated channels and integrated sales packages across screens. According to High View, the acquisition is designed to reinforce Goldvertise’s growth path and help it expand its role as an integrated monetisation partner across TV, CTV and non-linear offerings, while maintaining continuity for customers, partners and employees. High View’s shareholder base includes Beta Film, which has held a 50% stake in the group since 2023. High View founder Alexander Trauttmansdorff and Beta Film founder Jan Mojto previously worked in the Kirch Group.</p>

According to Stingray, the rollout is expected to cover the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands. The partnership is the latest example of an automotive brand expanding built-in digital entertainment options directly in the dashboard, rather than relying solely on smartphone mirroring. For content providers, such integrations can offer prominent placement and a more consistent user experience across models and markets, while carmakers aim to keep drivers inside their own infotainment environments. “We are thrilled to partner with a prestigious brand like Mercedes-Benz to enrich the in-car entertainment landscape,” said Tom Adams, Managing Director German Branch at Stingray. “Being selected by a leading global OEM like Mercedes-Benz affirms the strength of our technology and our ability to meet the most stringent requirements. This launch delivers on our commitment to provide drivers and passengers with unparalleled entertainment on the go, as we continue to set the standard for the future of the connected car experience.” Stingray Music will offer up to 100 curated music channels, which will be regularly refreshed with new releases and current hits. Stingray also plans to make around four million podcasts available through the in-car service. The interface will feature high-resolution album artwork and a visualiser, alongside streamlined controls designed for use in a driving environment, including browsing by genre and era. Alongside the music product, Stingray will add an in-car karaoke experience. Stingray Karaoke is slated to provide access to up to 100,000 songs, with search options including genre, title, artist and lyrics. The catalogue spans rock, pop, country and R&B, and will include family-friendly songs, with a multilingual interface intended to support users across different markets.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Larry Ellison has stepped in to strengthen Paramount Skydance’s hostile push for Warner Bros. Discovery, providing an “irrevocable personal guarantee” covering $40.4 billion (€34.4 billion) of equity financing for the bid. The move by the Oracle co-founder is designed to address one of the key objections raised by WBD’s board, which last week urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s offer and argued the Ellison family had still not provided an equity backstop. In an amended offer announcement on 22 December, Paramount said Larry Ellison would also stand behind any damages claims tied to the transaction and committed not to revoke the Ellison family trust or transfer its assets while the deal remains pending. David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has held its all-cash offer at $30 (€25.5) a share, but has increased the regulatory reverse break fee to $5.8 billion (€4.9 billion) and extended the tender offer to 21 January 2026. The revised package intensifies the contest with Netflix, which has an agreed transaction with WBD for its studio and streaming assets. WBD has continued to recommend shareholders back the Netflix deal and reject Paramount Skydance’s tender offer.</p>

In a regulatory statement, the company said the agreement follows clarifications published by the tax authorities in September 2025 and joint work on the definition and operational terms of catch-up television at Canal+. Canal+ said the outcome confirms that VAT applies at a reduced rate on its TV subscription services. The group has committed to a total of €363 million, with the payment schedule to be set at a later date. Canal+ added that it does not expect future tax audits for subsequent years to lead to any significant additional adjustments and said it would not take any further provisions in its accounts on this issue. Canal+ had previously indicated it had reached an agreement with French authorities relating to the tax dispute earlier in 2025.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Effective challenge to the alarming rise of far-right, anti-migrant politics starts with the grassrootsAusterity, cost of living pressures and a chronic lack of investment have damaged the physical and social fabric of some UK towns and neighbourhoods far more than others. In places where large numbers of people feel disheartened about living standards and prospects, and disenchanted by democratic politics as a result, a whole range of grievances can take hold. This year’s Guardian charity appeal is all about countering the alarming rise of far-right, anti-migrant and other extremist politics – and the misconceptions that fuel them. We and our partners are convinced that the fraying threads of communities can be woven back together with effort and imagination, supported by your generous donations.If polarisation is fuelled by digital capitalism’s commodification of attention – as illustrated by the role of social media in inflaming anti-migrant protests – cohesion and cooperation increase when people build bridges in real life. The charities and projects in this year’s appeal in this year’s appeal make and strengthen connections. Drawing on a range of techniques and activities, they seek to enhance confidence and reduce antagonism.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sign up hereTen years ago and newly married, I was invited to spend Christmas with my husband’s extended family. “We’re not doing gifts this year, there are too many of us,” my husband told me in early December when I queried who to buy for.So, I showed up with a roll of novelty Christmas pudding bin bags and wine for the hosts.

                    <p class="content-text">The Danish postal service has announced it will cease deliveries from 30 December after 400 years. Eventually, other countries may go down a similar routePredictions of the demise of letter writing are not new. The invention of the telegraph and the rise of the postcard were both seen as potential threats to a more leisurely, reflective form of communication. Yet by the close of the 20th century, more letters were being sent than ever, as social correspondence began to be supplemented by a boom in business mail.From Europe’s most tech-savvy society, however, comes ominous news. As of next week, Denmark’s state-run postal service will end all letter deliveries after doing the rounds for 400 years. Around 1,500 jobs are being cut, and the country’s beloved red letterboxes are being sold off. It will still be possible for Danes to send a card or a love letter to someone far away next Christmas, but only via the shops of a smaller private company or a costly home collection.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His debut single, Fool (If You Think It’s Over) was a transatlantic hit, earning him a best new artist Grammy nomination (he lost to Billy Joel, an artist the single had garnered comparisons to), but Rea announced that he “despised” the song: “It’s just not me.” He chafed at his record company’s expectations: his 1978 debut album, Whatever Happened to Benny Santini? got its title after his label suggested that he might consider adopting a stage name, and he later protested that the producers he worked with made his music too glossy and “smoothed-out”.

Kettle mentions Alan Bennett’s closing lines of The History Boys – “pass it on, boys” – which urge us to recognise the worth of what this country has inherited.

                    <p class="content-text">Sue O’Sullivan and Miriam David on being part of the women’s liberation movement, in response to a long read by Susanna Rustin on the Sex Discrimination Act. Plus a letter from Paul F Faupel We write as “members” of the women’s liberation movement (WLM) since the earliest days in London in the late 1960s, and we read Susanna Rustin’s long read with interest and appreciation (‘Pretty birds and silly moos’: the women behind the Sex Discrimination Act, 18 December). We were drawn to the liberation politics of the new WLM (no membership forms available or needed).Rustin refers briefly to WLM statements and conference resolutions in a way that might lead younger people to imagine a more formal organising force than ever existed. The WLM was a movement, not an organisation or a party. The national women’s liberation conferences that happened in those years often functioned as national “consciousness-raising” exercises. The most important “votes” were often about adding demands to our growing list, sometimes after long and volatile debates and discussions of emerging issues. Continue reading...</p>

For decades, City & Guilds has helped young people and adults get the skills they need to build their lives. That legacy now feels like it’s hanging by a thread due to the reported £22m cost-cutting drive.What’s just as worrying is the apparent shift from a nonprofit mindset to a profit-driven one. If education becomes just another business, there’s always a risk that profit comes before impact. For many learners – especially those with few other options – vocational training is their path forward. If prices rise or support is cut, it will hit these people hardest. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Polish TV viewing rose again in November as colder weather and a strong programme slate pushed audiences to spend more time in front of the screen, with both linear channels and streaming posting gains. Average daily time spent watching TV in November hit 4 hours 5 minutes, up around 14 minutes on October 2025’s 3 hours 51 minutes. The figure was also more than 1 minute higher than November 2024. Linear TV continued to draw viewers, helped by major events and established formats. Polsat, TVN and TVP1 were among the channels highlighted for attracting audiences during the month. The most-watched titles included World Cup football qualifiers on TVP1, drama series M jak Miłość on TVP2, flagship news Fakty on TVN, and Dancing with the Stars on Polsat. Streaming also moved to a new high. Online viewing’s share of total TV screen consumption increased by 0.6 percentage points month-on-month to 10.4% in November, up from 9.8% in October. The uplift was driven primarily by Netflix, which grew to a 2.1% share from 1.8% in October. YouTube held steady on 2.5% of total TV screen viewing.</p>

What a shame Labour wavers about saying soWarning. This column contains good news, when it is an (un)truth widely acknowledged that only grim stories attract public attention. News must be something someone somewhere doesn’t want printed, says the old maxim. Well, battalions of interests want to suppress good news: the overwhelmingly Tory or Reform UK press and antisocial media sites don’t want any stories to surface that might do credit to a Labour government.Among this deluge of disinformation and malevolence, when asked, a sour and disengaged electorate struggles to think of anything good this government has done. True, the prime minister and his cabinet are partly to blame for failing to tell their story, paint their picture, draw us a map of where they are going and why. They too often do good by stealth, afraid of what the right and business might say if they dare trumpet the strong social justice themes that drive most of what they do. But lay out what the government has done and there it is, plain as a pikestaff. There have been blunders, missteps, bad timing and wrongheaded manifesto pledges, but follow the money to define its identity. What has Labour raised from whom and how was it spent?

That was when Cricket Australia announced the schedule for the series: Perth first, Brisbane second. Starting the series on the bounciest, most Kryptonicious pitches in Australia – and the only major venues where England haven’t won a Test since 1986-87 – was a masterstroke, especially as Australia also had a day-night advantage at the Gabba. By the time England reached more batting-friendly climes, many of their batters already had scrambled brains. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">A side that once looked resilient has collapsed into historic futility, with Wolves now facing the grim task of avoiding the worst season English league football has ever seenSaturday’s defeat at home to Brentford means Wolves have taken just two points for 17 games. No side in the entire history of English league football, in any division, has ever made a worse start than that. To reach 11 points, the record low for a Premier League season set by Derby County in 2007-08, would require a significant improvement.How can this have happened? Wolves finished 16th last season, recovering after a dismal start. When Vitor Pereira took over on 19 December last year, they were second bottom on nine points from 16 games. They picked up 23 points from the final 22 games of the season and effectively ended any prospect of relegation with a run of six successive victories in the spring. How can a team go from averaging near enough a point a game to a tenth of that? The drop-off is extraordinary.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond. Subscribe for free here.

                    <p class="content-text">Sky has extended its UK and Ireland PGA Tour rights in a new four-year deal running through to the end of 2029. The renewal keeps Sky Sports as the exclusive broadcaster of all FedExCup regular season tournaments, including The Players Championship from Sawgrass, plus the FedExCup Playoffs and TOUR Championship each season. The agreement also adds continued live coverage of the 2026 and 2028 Presidents Cup, extending Sky’s access to leading international team competitions through the end of the decade alongside the Ryder Cup and Solheim Cup. Sky said the extension follows recent renewals with the Ladies European Tour, DP World Tour, USGA and Augusta National, maintaining a rights portfolio that includes all golf Majors, plus year-round men’s and women’s tour coverage for at least the next four years. As part of the wider partnership, Sky will continue to carry the Korn Ferry Tour and PGA TOUR Champions, while a new collaboration this year sees PGA Tour Studios working with Sky to provide additional camera feeds, direct access to TOUR content, remote replay capability and technical resources at each event. The relationship will expand again in 2026 with Sky talent featuring on the PGA Tour’s new World Feed for international broadcasts. Sky Chief Sports Officer Jonathan Licht said the renewed agreement underlines Sky’s long-term commitment to live golf and strengthens its “unrivalled golf offering”, pairing PGA Tour coverage with Majors and key team events. PGA Tour Executive Vice President, Media Norb Gambuzza pointed to audience growth on Sky in 2025, citing double-digit increases driven by UK and Ireland players including Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood and Justin Rose. Sky said PGA Tour viewing in the UK rose by more than 20% in 2025, with a 34% lift during McIlroy’s wins at The Players. Sky also reported a 54% year-on-year increase for the FedExCup Playoffs, highlighted by Rose’s FedEx St. Jude Championship victory and Fleetwood’s TOUR Championship win and FedExCup title. Sky added that golf helped deliver record viewing milestones in 2025, with The Masters and Ryder Cup contributing to Sky’s highest-ever viewing day and its most-watched weekend. The broadcaster also highlighted its production innovations, including the “world-first” Spidercam debut at The Open Championship at Royal Portrush.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Deutsche Telekom will expand its sports line-up with a comprehensive live golf offering on TV platform MagentaTV from January 2026, launching two dedicated channels, MS Golf 1 and MS Golf 2. The package brings more than 300 days of live golf per year and a total of 131 tournaments, spanning the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour, alongside coverage from the Korn Ferry Tour and the PGA Tour Champions, and will run until the end of 2029. The new channels will be available to MagentaTV customers across all subscription plans and, in 2026, will be included at no extra cost. MagentaSport subscribers will also be able to access the golf coverage via the MagentaSport platforms as part of their existing subscription. “Golf has a new home on MagentaTV. With this package, we are offering Germany’s most comprehensive live golf coverage ever,” said Arnim Butzen, Head of TV at Telekom, adding that the coverage is intended to appeal both to established fans and to younger viewers discovering the sport. MagentaTV plans a dual-channel approach designed to handle overlapping live windows across tours. MS Golf 1 will carry full tournament coverage, while MS Golf 2 will provide additional feeds such as featured groups and alternative streams, alongside curated highlights. The offering will also include features on leading players, current stories and archive content, with further programming available on demand. Coverage is set to begin on 15 January 2026 with tournaments staged in Dubai and Honolulu. The schedule is built around the traditional tournament week, with live broadcasts from Thursday to Sunday and additional programming on the remaining weekdays, including analysis, highlight formats and background features. Selected events are also planned for MagentaTV’s freemium tier as an on-ramp for new audiences. A key draw of the rights deal is the Ryder Cup, which Telekom will show live and exclusively on MagentaTV and MagentaSport in 2027 and 2029. The competition will be staged at Adare Manor in Ireland in 2027 and at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota in 2029. For viewers in German-speaking markets, Telekom highlighted two 2026 stops in particular: the Austrian Alpine Open presented by Kitzbühel Tirol from 28 to 31 May, and the BMW International Open in Eichenried near Munich from 2 to 5 July. The PGA Tour Champions slate will feature veteran players including Bernhard Langer and Alex Cejka, as well as international names such as Ernie Els. Production will be handled by thinXpool TV, the editorial team behind MagentaSport’s golf coverage, which has twice won the German Television Award in the sports category. MagentaTV also signalled a stronger push into digital formats around the rights, with social media coverage and a modern storytelling approach, pointing to German players Marcel Siem and Stephan Jäger as key on- and off-course personalities within the new proposition.</p>

It means that after five years of legal arguments a large number of the claimants in both codes face the risk of having their cases struck out before they come to trial.The appeal judge, Mr Justice Dexter Dias, ruled that the judge presiding over the management of the case, Senior Master Jeremy Cook, had been right to find that the claimants firm, Rylands Garth, had failed to fulfil its obligations to disclose necessary medical material to the defendants, World Rugby, the Wales Rugby Union, and the Rugby Football Union in one case, and the Rugby Football League in the other.

                    <p class="content-text">TNT Sports has been confirmed as the exclusive UK live broadcast and digital media rights partner for the Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games, in a deal struck by Commonwealth Sport with Warner Bros. Discovery.  Under the agreement, TNT Sports will create a dedicated linear channel for the UK and Ireland, with more than 600 hours of live coverage planned. Every sport and event will also be available to stream on HBO Max in the UK following the platform’s launch in March 2026, with HBO Max set to become the new streaming home of TNT Sports in the UK and Ireland.  Commonwealth Sport said the appointment forms part of a wider “re-imagining” of the Games, and positioned the partnership as evidence of ongoing broadcaster and host-market backing, with Amdavad 2030 confirmed and “strong interest” signalled for 2034.  The Commonwealth Games is within Group B of Ofcom’s listed events, suggesting that highlights may still be released to a UK free-to-air broadcaster. Glasgow 2026 will be the first edition since 1954 not to have the BBC as the UK live broadcaster. Katie Sadleir, CEO of Commonwealth Sport, said the deal would open up “exciting new ways” for fans to connect with the event, with more live availability and an increased focus on athlete storytelling. Scott Young, EVP at Warner Bros. Discovery Sports Europe, said WBD would bring its production and storytelling approach to deliver coverage that is “comprehensive, immersive and accessible”. Phil Batty, CEO of Glasgow 2026, said the partnership would help broaden the breadth and depth of content and reach new audiences.  Glasgow 2026 is scheduled to run from 23 July to 2 August, with organisers expecting around 3,000 athletes from 74 nations and territories. The programme combines 10 sports and 6 Para sports, with 133 sessions of sport and 215 gold medals.  Commonwealth Sport noted the deal follows other territory agreements already in place for 2026, including Sky New Zealand (confirmed July 2025) and Australia’s Seven Network (confirmed April 2025).</p>

He flew past the substitutes and staff, skidded left, and sprinted up the line all wide-eyed and excited, shaking his fists and beaming. He had gone 15 or 20 metres, maybe 25 when he realised – just a fraction later than everyone else – that something had gone wrong again. So Villarreal’s manager put the brakes on and his head down, and turned back towards the bench feeling almost as silly as this was getting. This, he already suspected, was going to be one of those days.They had been playing 16 minutes and the goal Villarreal had scored, the goal Jules Koundé scored for them, wasn’t a goal at all. Just as the chance they made after 80 seconds wasn’t, Nicolas Pépé putting wide from a yard out. Just as Ayoze Pérez’s opportunity on six minutes wasn’t a goal, Tajon Buchanan’s effort on 13 wasn’t, and Raphinha’s on nine minutes was. One moment – a dash, a tumble and a penalty and from nowhere Villarreal trailed Barcelona as two of La Liga’s best teams met on the Mediterranean, not in Miami. Barcelona beat Villarreal 2-0.

                    <p class="content-text">Channel 4 has published a year-end snapshot of what it calls the UK’s “Altogether Different” viewing habits, as it reported fresh streaming milestones for 2025 and pointed to a slate of genre launches that helped drive growth. The broadcaster said viewer minutes on Channel 4 streaming reached 69 billion year-to-date, up 14% year on year, as it continues its shift towards becoming a digital-first public service streamer. The roundup leans into seasonal and binge-viewing behaviour. Channel 4 said 87 million minutes of Christmas programming were streamed in November alone, with titles cited including Home Alone, Father Christmas and Terry Pratchett’s The Abominable Snow Baby. London was the earliest region for festive streaming in November with 16 million minutes, followed by the North West and the East of England on 9 million minutes each. In one of the more unusual data points, Channel 4 said 80 people streamed The Snowman on the hottest day of the year, when temperatures reached 35.8C on 1 July. The broadcaster also linked a winter lift for A Place in the Sun, saying November delivered the show’s highest monthly streaming performance of the year with 2.14 million views. Channel 4 also cited “fun facts” from individual viewing, including one viewer streaming 25 episodes of Married at First Sight UK back-to-back, while estimating that the time spent watching The Great British Bake Off equated to “206 million Victoria Sponges” in baking terms. On broader performance, Channel 4 said its total audience (all individuals) rose 2%, with share of 16–34 viewing up 1% and ABC1 share up 6%. The company also used the update to highlight content performance across genres. Channel 4 said Virgin Island was its biggest launch for young audiences in more than 20 years; Game of Wool was its biggest format launch since The Jury; Bonnie Blue: 1000 Men and Me was its most streamed documentary ever; Patience was its highest drama debut since It’s a Sin; and Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping delivered its largest comedy launch since 2018.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Netflix has put in place $25 billion (€21.3 billion) of new bank facilities as it moves to replace part of the funding package backing its proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. In an SEC filing dated December 19, 2025, Netflix said it entered into two senior unsecured credit agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association acting as administrative agent: a $5 billion (€4.3 billion) revolving credit facility and $20 billion (€17.1 billion) of delayed draw term loans split into two tranches of $10 billion (€8.5 billion) over 2 years and $10 billion (€8.5 billion) over three years. Netflix said proceeds can be used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price under the merger agreement signed on December 4, 2025, alongside transaction-related fees and expenses, and optionally to refinance certain debt. The company also said the new facilities reduce its previously disclosed bridge commitments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The revolver permits borrowing, repayment and reborrowing until the earliest of: three years after completion of the merger, termination of the merger agreement, or December 19, 2030. Netflix can extend maturity by up to 1 year, up to twice, subject to customary conditions. Netflix previously disclosed a debt commitment letter providing for up to $59 billion (€50.4 billion) of senior unsecured bridge term loans to support the transaction, underlining how the company is now shifting towards a more “permanent” funding structure as the deal progresses. </p>

                    <p class="content-text">CNN International Commercial has released findings from a new global study into international news consumption, arguing audiences are placing a higher premium on trusted, credible reporting as misinformation spreads across social platforms. The research, conducted by Differentology, surveyed 2,400 international news consumers across 20 markets spanning Europe, the US, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. It found 7 in 10 respondents believe international news is “more important than ever”, even as local outlets remain heavily relied upon. The report also points to a strong social component in how audiences now follow news. Some 28% said their preferred source of information is a social media platform, while 62% said they seek out user generated content from international news organisations. UGC from global news outlets was rated 2.5 times more credible than UGC from non-news professionals such as influencers and citizen journalists, highlighting the tension between the speed of social media and the assurance associated with established journalism brands. The broadcaster has been a target of US President Donald Trump for its perceived liberal bias. Its future ownership is currently under question after Netflix tabled a bid for parent Warner Bros. Discovery. CNN is not a part of the bid and is likely to join other linear channels in a new company named Discovery Global. CNN International Commercial said concern about misinformation is driving demand for verification and context, citing findings that 6 in 10 are worried about the credibility of information sources and want platforms that can check facts and provide in-depth coverage. Jo Tenzer, Director of Audience Insights at CNN International Commercial, said the study shows consumers want “credibility and context” amid “endless content and rising misinformation”, positioning CNN as a brand built on clarity and depth. The study also links trust in news environments to advertiser outcomes. CNN said 71% of respondents believe CNN content enhances the credibility of brands that advertise with the network, while 80% of brands that advertise on CNN build meaningful brand trust, underpinning its pitch as a “safe and premium” space for advertisers. CNN International Commercial oversees business operations for CNN’s properties outside the United States, including advertising sales, sponsorship, commercial content development, content sales, brand licensing, distribution and out-of-home operations.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Julie Christie remains as magnetic as ever in the mammoth big screen adaptation of Boris Pasternak’s once dangerous novelThere’s no more perfect illustration of the cinematic crossroads of the mid-1960s than the year Julie Christie had in 1965. First, she starred as an amoral model in John Schlesinger’s Darling, a snapshot of Swinging London that reflected the trendy, flashy, forward-thinking culture that had seduced young adults. Then she starred as an elusive Russian beauty in Doctor Zhivago, a three-hour-plus historical epic from David Lean that was as stodgy and old-fashioned as Darling was suggestive of the future. There was an appetite for both that year – credit Christie’s astonishing magnetism for that, at least in part – but a sense that one era was crashing into another and times were about to change.It seems fitting, then, that Doctor Zhivago is about what happens when history takes a turn and a band of insurgents make a once-stable and familiar place seem completely unrecognizable. It’s easy to imagine a master like Lean, who’d just made Lawrence of Arabia a few years earlier, feeling a bit like his hero, Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif), a celebrated poet whose work suddenly falls out of favor after the Russian Revolution. Though Doctor Zhivago was honored with a raft of Oscar nominations – and five wins, mostly in technical categories – many contemporary reviews had dismissed it as an ossified romance, disengaged with the harsh realities of early-to-mid-1900s Russia. Even 60 years later, it feels like a relic of an earlier era. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Access Advance has announced that Hisense Group Holdings has joined the HEVC Advance patent pool as a licensee. The move gives Hisense a single licence covering access to “tens of thousands” of patents declared essential to implementing the HEVC/H.265 video compression standard, under what Access Advance describes as global FRAND [Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory] terms. Access Advance said the agreement followed an extended engagement between the two companies and positions Hisense alongside a run of recent additions and expanded relationships across the Access Advance pools, including Xiaomi, MSI and Transsion, plus broadened arrangements with Huawei, HP and Sharp. Hisense, headquartered in Qingdao, is one of the world’s largest TV manufacturers, with products sold in more than 160 countries and regions. Access Advance CEO Peter Moller said Hisense’s participation reflected growing industry recognition that “transparent, efficient licensing solutions” benefit both innovators and implementers across the video technology ecosystem.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Chris Philp says Mary-Ann Stephenson is dismissing ‘legitimate concerns about mass migration’In her interview with PA Media, Mary-Anne Stephenson, the new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, also criticised calls for the UK to leave the European convention on human rights. This is a policy supported by both Reform UK and the Conservative party, although Stephenson did not talk about that in the published interview remarks. Kevin Rawlinson has more on what she said on this topic here.The Conservatives and Reform UK have strongly criticised the new head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission for criticising the “demonisation” of migrants”.I think it’s really important that we have honesty in the way that we talk about human rights, and that we also have a recognition that the demonisation of migrants, the creating this idea that migration causes huge risks for the country, can make the lives not just of migrants to the UK, but of ethnic minority UK citizens, very, very difficult.Reform believes we should deport terrorists, rapists and serious foreign criminals. The vast majority will agree with me that we must prioritise the rights of British people, whatever their ethnicity.These comments by the new Labour-appointed human rights chief are a disgrace. Once again, the left tries paint those opposed to mass immigration and illegal immigration as racist.Mass migration with no integration has undermined social cohesion. Sex crimes by foreign nationals are up 62%, foreign criminals and illegal immigrants routinely abuse human rights, modern slavery and asylum laws to stay in the UK. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">  Every few months the industry seems to rediscover the same argument: music television has lost its relevance because viewers now watch clips on YouTube and listen to music on Spotify and similar services. The conclusion sounds logical, yet it rests on a narrow interpretation of how people actually use their TVs and how they consume music. It is true that the arrival of YouTube 20 years ago reshaped the category. Music channels, instead of adapting, gradually reduced the share of music and moved into reality formats. The result was predictable: audiences drifted elsewhere [1]. But this does not mean that the underlying idea of a curated, continuous music stream has become obsolete. It simply means the format stalled while the rest of the market kept evolving. The TV screen never stopped being a music surface The narrative about “declining linear TV” is valid, but it hides an important nuance. Connected TV usage keeps rising across Europe and the United States. At the same time, YouTube reports hundreds of millions of hours of content consumed on connected screens each day, what is a significant portion of it music videos [2]. In other words: viewers did not abandon the TV screen as a place for music, they just couldn’t find a relevent content on music channels. An era of playlists A recurring misconception is that if viewers have YouTube, Spotify or TikTok, they no longer need a linear music service. This misses the fundamental point. Modern music consumption is built around playlists [3], not albums, as it had been earlier. Moreover, most users rely on curation (editorial or algorithmic), rather building their own playlists after hours of content serfing. A well-designed music channel functions in exactly that space. It offers a stable, recognisable flow with a clear mood or genre logic. Moreover, IPTV/OTT platforms provide users with such functions, as “Pause”, “Time Shift”, giving the viewer even more control on the playlist playback, than a freemium version of Spotify, so the old argument about “lack of control” is weaker than it once was. Meanwhile, channels usually refresh their playlists every day, which is not always the case with playlists on streamings. The visual layer matters as well. Music videos are not incidental content. They shape the listening experience and create atmosphere. Bars, cafés, co-working spaces and households increasingly use CTV for background entertainment that must be consistent and unobtrusive. A continuous music stream fits that use case far better than a sequence of ads interrupting every clip on ad-supported platforms. Making Music Work on TV Platforms For music to deliver real value on TV platforms, the channel offering has to be built with intent. First, there needs to be a balanced selection across genres and styles. This doesn’t mean adding endless options, but giving space to core categories with clearly defined identities. The goal is to reflect how people actually listen — across moods, times of day, and genre preferences. Second, meaningful variety matters. Even two channels that look similar at first glance can offer very different vibes. One may focus on fast-paced chart hits, the other on slower, more curated selections. This gives viewers real choice depending on their mood or context. Market exits do not mean the end of music TV While reading this, you may ask: if music television is still relevant and effective for TV platforms, then why is MTV pulling out? It’s a fair question. But in reality, this doesn’t signal the end of music television — it reflects a shift in priorities by one media group. With a large and diverse portfolio, such companies naturally focus on assets that generate the highest margins. That doesn’t mean the market for music content on TV has disappeared. The demand is still there. People still listen to music — the question is who will step in to serve it, and how make TV a convinient media for music conumption. How new players are reshaping the format A new wave of music services is rethinking what a music TV channel should be. Music Box is one of the networks working in this space. Its channels are built around curated playlists designed specifically for lean-back CTV viewing. Instead of relying solely on automated systems, editorial teams maintain the flow and adjust rotations with attention to pacing and emotional continuity. This hybrid approach, ie, human curation supported by analytics, is closer to how people consume playlists today. Another area of reinvention is visual quality. A large part of global music catalogues exists only in older SD masters. Music Box and several other networks have invested in upscaling workflows to make these videos suitable for modern HD screens. The improvement in picture quality alone changes how viewers perceive “legacy” content. A category that Europe may need more than it realises If we look at the broader CTV trends — fatigue from constant choice [4], rising use of passive viewing modes, stable interest in music videos [5], and the continued dominance of playlists — the return of music television is not surprising. The format solves a practical problem: it provides a curated, predictable, uninterrupted flow of music on the screen viewers already use for video. Music television does not compete with streaming giants in functionality or catalogue size. It competes in user experience. And in that space, the format has clear room to grow — as long as it reflects how people listen to music today, not twenty years ago. Importantly, today’s listeners rarely rely on a single platform. According to IFPI’s data, people use an average of more than seven different methods [6] to interact with music — from audio streaming and video platforms to radio, social media, and live performance. This multi-channel behaviour opens space for music television to claim a distinctive role, especially on the big screen. ** [1] The Guardian (2025). ‘No one makes money from them’: with MTV channels switching off, is the music video under threat?

It’s not just clever, tender and blackly comic – it’s a beautiful meditation on what it means to live (and die) well• The 50 best TV shows of 2025• More on the best culture of 2025Dying for Sex is about a fortysomething woman leaving her husband and having lots of experimental sex after she is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Except, of course, it’s not. It’s about so much more than that. By the end, the sex scenes – many and varied though they may be – are just a bagatelle.Partly this is because there is no false hope offered here. None of the sexy set pieces are a full escape from reality. The series is based on a true story and the podcast made about Molly Kochan’s decision to cram years of sexual experience into the little time she was told she had left before metastasised breast cancer killed her. Whatever Molly does, whatever we see her do – enjoy or not enjoy – we know it will not change the ultimate outcome. This is the frame in which all the scenes of sex parties, age-gapped hookups, discovery of “pup play” and mastering the tricky latches on cock cages in Molly’s pursuit of her first partnered orgasm are set.

One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.There is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry.

Treating interviewers like a slice of Panettone aside, the most shocking thing about this assertion is that it’s not entirely implausible. Juventus have barely scraped a few good performances, but the overwhelming sense of inconsistency throughout Serie A means that’s no reason to rule them out for the top prize.Spalletti can tuck into his Christmas dinner knowing Juventus beat Roma 2-1 to close within a point of fourth place, securing three competitive wins in a row, with Loïs Openda finally breaking his Serie A duck, and Gleison Bremer returning for his first start sincehis meniscus tear on 27 September. The quality in the squad was always present, so with a little confidence, momentum and players beginning to gel with their new coach, there’s plenty for fans to get their teeth into.

Then he physically assaulted both parents.The incident, which happened in the city of Szczecin in north-west Poland, reflects an increasingly hostile atmosphere for Ukrainians in the country, a dramatic turnaround from the mood in 2022. Then, in the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion, hundreds of thousands of Poles put on a show of support and hospitality for their neighbours, volunteering at the border and offering up their homes to refugees.

That is the question. Aston Villa’s winning streak continued against Manchester United, but so did the nagging doubts. They were the lesser team by several measures – fewer shots (12-15), less possession (43-57), fewer big chances (2-3). As usual, the victory was a slender one. As usual, our friend xG was unimpressed: according to Opta, United edged it 1.31-1.02. But, as every fan knows, games are not won by xG. They are won by solid teamwork, shrewd management and individual talent – and Villa have all three. Morgan Rogers may be their only star, but he’s delivering like Father Christmas. Unai Emery is wily, battle-hardened, five years ahead of Ruben Amorim. If Rogers profited from Leny Yoro’s naivety, that was probably because Emery had spotted that Yoro is not a right-back, and told Rogers to start wide, cut in and torment him. Talent and management, working together.

                    <p class="content-text">Chadderton Town Hall, OldhamSet over the course of local village hall fundraiser, Jim Cartwright’s play is charmingly performed and has a built-in sense of communityYesterday it was the salsa class. Coming up is the panto. On other days, it may be anything from language lessons to arts and crafts. Today in this multipurpose venue, it is the turn of the annual Christmas fair, with its bric-a-brac stalls, grotto and tree. Sitting on four sides of the elegant ballroom in Chadderton town hall, a refuge for Oldham Coliseum during renovations, we require no leap of the imagination to picture ourselves at a genuine local fundraiser.That gives Jim Cartwright’s 2012 play a built-in sense of community. Director Jimmy Fairhurst keeps the house lights up, save for the most poignant speeches, and expects us to clap along to the Christmas hits and cheer the young carol singers as if they were children of our own. Blurring the fact/fiction divide, the interval is less a break in the action than a chance to buy the scented candles and prints by Oldham artists that are otherwise part of the set.

Since then they have moved to the north-west and are heading into a second Africa Cup of Nations as Tanzania internationals together.This is the fourth time Tanzania, who sit 112th in Fifa’s rankings, have qualified for the tournament but they are yet to secure a victory. In Côte d’Ivoire in 2023, Allarakhia and Mnoga were part of a squad that secured draws against Zambia and DR Congo, but that was not enough to get them out of the group. Nigeria, the highest-ranked side in the group, will be their first opponents on Tuesday before clashes with Tunisia and Uganda in Morocco for the Taifa Stars. Continue reading...</p>

While many may have noticed the addition of five new sports in baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash, a mini-revolution is happening on the water within a sport that will no longer have a lightweight category but will have five coastal rowing events in 2028.

                    <p class="content-text">His interference in the region has been aided by the collapse of the leftist forces that once pushed back against US imperialismFor the past generation, Latin America has been a place of unstable stability. Marked on the surface by protests, political pendulum swings and spectacular scandals, most of the region has, since the democratisation of the 1980s and 1990s, remained firmly democratic and free of war between states. Though scarred by the violence of armed groups and increasingly powerful criminal organisations, it has, by and large, lived up to its self-assumed moniker of a “zone of peace”.Which is why this year has felt so jarring. Throughout 2025, the first year of Donald Trump’s second term, analysts have obsessively parsed potential US military incursions into a hemisphere once defined by its unified defence of national sovereignty. But the fixation on whether Washington’s escalating pressure on Nicolás Maduro presages a physical military invasion of Venezuela has distracted from the real story: the larger shift towards direct intervention has already happened, and it has faced remarkably little resistance. More than 100 people have been killed in US maritime strikes that experts characterise as extrajudicial executions, and the loudest objections have come not from Latin American presidents or regional organisations, but from the US Congress.Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires. She compiles the Latin America Daily Briefing and is part of the Ideas Letter’s editorial team Continue reading...</p>

The liver is designed to process the toxins in alcohol and either break them down into usable units or get rid of them. The waste products are then filtered from the blood and excreted in urine or stools.Sweat, on the other hand, has a very different job. Although it can contain extremely small amounts of some metabolic byproducts, its purpose is temperature regulation (and, in some situations, to signal stress or fear). “Sweating is not the means to remove toxins,” says Taylor. “Going for a run or sitting in a sauna after a night of drinking won’t reduce the toxins produced by metabolising alcohol, and it won’t lower your blood alcohol level.” Continue reading...</p>

It’s a gastro capital with cuisines from all around the world. One night, Indian, French the next, Peruvian, Ethiopian. You can travel the globe without leaving Hackney.This time of year, I’m super busy planning the un-Royal Variety show – a punk pastiche of the royal version – and so I can’t be bothered with meal prep and washing up, and find myself eating out an awful lot. Most food trends I can get behind (with the exception of truffle – yuck!). But one pernicious dining trend that refuses to go away and which I detest is “small plates”.Jonny Woo is a performer, drag artist, writer, and co-owner of The Divine, he will be hosting his Un-Royal Variety at Soho Theatre Walthamstow 26-28 November 2026.

                    <p class="content-text">From exile to family dysfunction, street food to sex, this stylish novel about a mother visiting her estranged gay son in Tokyo explores familiar themesWhile we now use it to mean a fuss or convoluted mess, the origins of the word palaver, the title of Bryan Washington’s third novel, lie in the Portuguese term palavra, which simply means “word”. Over time, and possibly coloured by the historical context of Portuguese colonists’ rampages across the globe, “palaver” came to refer to a complex debate or negotiation between two culturally distinct parties.Culture clashes, conflicted conversations, oppositions and exchanges are principal interests for Washington. His debut novel, 2020’s Memorial, was a sobering but sensitive consideration of a fracturing interracial gay relationship set between Houston and Osaka. This was followed in 2023 by Family Meal, again taking place in Houston, with its pithy observations of a combustible queer love triangle. Palaver centres on the tense relationship between protagonists “the son” and “the mother”. Guarded and prickly, the son is an American who has lived in Tokyo for the best part of a decade, teaching English as a foreign language. Throughout this period, he’s been estranged from his Jamaican-American mother back home in Texas. The novel opens with the equally crabby mother unexpectedly turning up on her son’s doorstep, and mostly covers the week and a half they spend together, moving between their two perspectives. Illuminated by Tokyo’s harsh neon, mother and son edge around reckonings with their bitter past of familial dysfunction, and make their way towards something resembling rapprochement.

Their latest record follows suit with four winding, blissed-out tracks over a 40-minute run time. But it’s not just overindulgent lounge music: the analogue loops quietly build to transcendental heights, nudged along by wandering sax solos, spritely keys and other cosmic flourishes. It’s a lush, often moving odyssey which, towards the end of the epic 18-minute closer, climaxes in an effervescent flurry. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Houseplants appear to make conversation and yearn for lost friends in a witty yet luminous documentary from Jesse McLeanThis experimental documentary by Jesse McLean about houseplants inspired me to go around my house and water all my vegetal housemates and treat the mealybug infections afflicting the jade plants in my office. Now I feel better for it in every way, while also basking in the afterglow of this luminous piece of film-making that is cinematic fertiliser for thought.With a gentle touch that blends wonder and wit, prioritising none of the different voices and viewpoints we hear over any other (and that includes from plants themselves), McLean builds up an audiovisual collage of perspectives on plant-people relations. Some of the humans featured are merely silent subjects, often as still as the potted protagonists themselves. One woman is a bit woo-woo – but persuasively and charmingly so – about how one of her plants seemed to wither away with loneliness after being separated from her mother-in-law’s tongue plant it sat next to for years, only to become rejuvenated when they were reunited.

Now, an observatory is offering stellar nocturnal events tooA tawny owl screeches nearby in the dark and her mate replies, hooting eerily from the forest below. A white dome floats in the gloaming above a plain black doorway outlined with red light, like a portal to another dimension. I’m in Grizedale Forest, far from any light-polluting cities, to visit the Lake District’s first public observatory and planetarium, which opened in May.Grizedale Observatory offers immersive films in the planetarium and three-hour stargazing events that go on late into the night. There are sessions on astrophotography and, on moonless nights, dark sky astronomy with the chance to see “a glittering tapestry of stars, galaxies, nebulae and star clusters”. Its director, Gary Fildes, is a veteran in the field, having founded and led three UK observatories over two decades. The goal at Grizedale, he says, is to create “an immersive, year-round astronomy and science destination that brings the beauty of the Lake District skies to visitors”. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Pier Paolo Pasolini’s notorious film is now 50 years old, and its cavalcade of shocking cruelty and violence still leaves a stark impact on its viewers. Film-makers explain why Pasolini ‘was a saint to us’Abel Ferrara was there at the beginning. In his new memoir, Scene, the cult director describes his experience at the American premiere of Salò, the hugely controversial final film from Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini. At the beginning of the film – at which Ferrara and company arrived with wine and cheese, given its length – there were 15 people in the audience. Once the credits rolled, there were eight. “I was standing with like six people,” Ferrara says now. “And you know, two or three of those people I still see.”When it comes to Salò, it seems that you never forget your first time. The film, which has reached its 50th anniversary in 2025, is known for its seemingly endless cavalcade of cruelty and violence, leaves a stark impact on those who come across it. “We had high expectations, but it went beyond that,” Ferrara says. “He had just died, so he was a saint to us.” But not everyone so readily embraces the film on first viewing. Film-maker Catherine Breillat says that at first, she didn’t like Salò, “regretted seeing it, [and] sort of wished that [I] hadn’t”. For Breillat, “you have to be ready to see Salò. Its like Arthur’s Round Table; it will come to you when you’re ready. There’s a moment where you can sit down with the knights of the Round Table, after following a dangerous path, and you don’t disappear into the abyss.” Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The Al Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif was the most prominent name among so many targeted for simply bearing witness to the truthIn January this year, Anas al-Sharif was filmed being lifted into the air after taking off his helmet and flak jacket to celebrate a ceasefire that would prove all too temporary in Gaza. This summer, the Palestinian journalist broke down while reporting on starvation in his home town that is now a war zone. A bystander told him: “Persist, Anas, you are our voice”.But al-Sharif’s popularity in Gaza made him a target. In July, international agencies warned of the danger he was in as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks, falsely labelling him a Hamas terrorist. His employer, Al Jazeera, insisted he restrict his reporting to the more protected al-Shifa hospital after his father and many colleagues were killed. In August, a few months short of his 29th birthday, al-Sharif and six others were killed in a direct attack on a media tent next to the hospital. In a posthumous post he said: “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice.”Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

It’s 7.30am, and on this sheltered tidal creek on the River Dart, the water is barely moving: a gentle pulse in the scum line along the beach is the last gasp of the tide’s energy.When I join the main course of the Dart, the water state changes.

                    <p class="content-text">German telco Deutsche Telekom has expanded the FAST offering on its TV platform MagentaTV with the addition of Scooore and Landlust TV. Both channels, provided by Hamburg-based broadcaster Sportdigital, are now available to all MagentaTV customers, further broadening the platform’s mix of sports and lifestyle programming. Scooore, Sportdigital’s football-focused FAST Channel, features weekly highlights as well as ClubTV content from Liverpool FC (LFC TV) and Manchester City (CityTV) with behind-the-scenes coverage, interviews and exclusive features. The channel also screens selected matches from the pay-TV service Sportdigital Fußball as full-length repeats alongside a number of live games. In the coming days, Scooore will additionally show time-delayed fixtures from the Africa Cup of Nations. Landlust TV, produced by Sportdigital in collaboration with publishing house Landwirtschaftsverlag Münster, provides 24/7 programming centred on rural life, traditional crafts and regional culture. The channel features stories about people, their professions and hobbies, along with reports on nature, gardening, cooking with regional ingredients and rediscovered trades such as mirror-making or kettle-repairing. It also offers features from regions including the Elbe Sandstone Mountains as well as guidance on designing self-sufficiency gardens. With the latest additions, MagentaTV now carries a total of seven FAST Channels. The first five services, operated by Mainstream Media, launched on 9 December 2025. Deutsche Telekom aims to expand the line-up substantially, targeting around 40 FAST Channels by mid-2026 across film, entertainment, docutainment, sports and lifestyle.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">In Germany, the neo-Nazi terrorist Beate Zschäpe has made a public display of her remorse – but remains silent on key aspects of her crimesIt’s a strange season to talk about forgiveness. While streets glow with fairy lights and shop windows promise that compassion is only a gift-box away, Germany is once again confronted with the unresolved wounds of its recent past. The trap of the season is this: believing that every gesture of regret must be met with mercy. As if forgiveness was a resource available to anyone who is reasonable enough to move on, no matter how atrociously they have been treated.It is certainly not that simple for the families of the victims of the National Socialist Underground (NSU). During the 2000s, the neo-Nazi terror organisation killed 10 people, nine of them immigrants, mostly small business owners, and one policewoman. Because investigators focused on probing the victims’ families and communities rather than on Nazis, the NSU was able to continue murdering without interference. German media reported on the atrocities as die Dönermorde the kebab murders, as if it was some exotic true-crime phenomenon.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a Guardian Europe columnist Continue reading...</p>

Witty, unsentimental – and not one to say no to another brandy. At family parties, he’s the one gossiping about the latest scandal to catch up with a local MP, or regaling us with tales of the outrageous philandering of various Sheffield Wednesday players over the past 40 years. He could make anything – a jacket potato, a broken relationship – funny, somehow.We would often spend Christmas morning with him and his family, before going our separate ways. But, one Christmas, about 10 years ago, when he was supposed to be meeting family abroad, he fell down the stairs, whisky in one hand, suitcase in the other, and broke his ribs. The hospital had patched him up and told him not to fly. So, here he was back with us in Sheffield, making the best of it, but looking increasingly peaky. Continue reading...</p>

It was just so craven, rolling out the red carpet for Trump. Their next art-activist event unfolded like clockwork.Led By Donkeys made a nine-minute film about Trump’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein which ended: “The president of the United States was a long-time close friend of America’s most notorious child sex trafficker. He’s alleged to be mentioned, numerous times, in the files arising from the investigation into that child sex trafficker … Now that president, Donald Trump, is sleeping here, in Windsor Castle.” (Trump says that he fell out with Epstein years before Epstein was first arrested, and has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.)

                    <p class="content-text">Moscow reported to have forcibly moved dozens of people from border village; Florida peace talks described as ‘productive’. What we know on day 1,398The Ukrainian army was battling an attempted Russian breakthrough in the Sumy region, it said on Sunday, after reports that Moscow forcibly moved 50 people from a border village there. That marks a renewed Russian advance in the part of the region largely spared from intense ground fighting since Ukraine regained land there in a 2022 counteroffensive. “Fighting is currently ongoing in the village of Grabovske,” Ukraine’s joint taskforce said, adding the troops were “making efforts to drive the occupiers back into Russian territory”. It has also refuted media reports saying Moscow’s troops were in the neighbouring Ryasne village. Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian rights ombudsman said Russian troops forcibly moved about 50 people from Grabovske to Russia. There was no official comment from Russia. On Saturday, the Russian army said it had captured the village of Vysoke, a short distance from Grabovske.US and Ukrainian envoys issued a joint statement on Sunday saying talks in Miami had been “productive and constructive” but did not announce any apparent breakthrough in efforts to end the Russian invasion. “Over the last three days in Florida, the Ukrainian delegation held a series of productive and constructive meetings with American and European partners,” Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ukraine’s top negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said in separate statements on X on Sunday. Witkoff posted: “Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future.”The Kremlin on Sunday denied that three-way talks between Ukraine, Russia and the US were on the cards. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a day earlier that Washington had mooted the trilateral format, which would mark Moscow and Kyiv’s first face-to-face negotiations in half a year, but the Ukrainian president expressed scepticism that they would lead to progress. Russian news agencies reported Vladimir Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, as telling reporters: “At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not in preparation.” Russian representatives have also been in southern Florida for discussions with the US over Ukraine, with a Kremlin envoy saying on Saturday that the talks had been pressing on “constructively”.Keir Starmer discussed efforts to achieve a “just and lasting end” to the war in a Sunday call with Donald Trump, the British prime minister’s office said in a statement after the Florida talks. “The two leaders began by reflecting on the war in Ukraine,” Starmer’s office said in a readout of the call, adding they had discussed the work of the so-called “coalition of the willing” countries that have pledged to support Kyiv.Russia has renewed its criticism of efforts by Europe and Ukraine to amend US proposals to end the war in Ukraine, saying they did not improve prospects for peace. Rory Carroll reports that Putin aide Ushakov told reporters on Sunday that the proposed tweaks to Washington’s plan could prolong the conflict. “I am sure that the proposals that the Europeans and Ukrainians have made or are trying to make definitely do not improve the document and do not improve the possibility of achieving long-term peace,” Ushakov said. He added that he had not seen the exact proposals and that his criticism was “not a forecast”.US intelligence reports continue to warn that Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and reclaiming parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire, Reuters reported six sources familiar with intelligence as saying, even as negotiators seek an end to the war that would leave Russia with far less territory. The most recent of the reports dates from late September, one of the sources said. The intelligence contradicts the Russian leader’s denials that he is a threat to Europe. “The intelligence has always been that Putin wants more,” Mike Quigley, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, told Reuters. “The Europeans are convinced of it. The Poles are absolutely convinced of it. The Baltics think they’re first.” Continue reading...</p>

It’s a crass affair with a thin, half-hearted performance from SharpeHere’s my position. If you are going to create a miniseries about the life, death and music of one of the defining geniuses of the last 1,000 years of western civilisation, and if you are going to use as your source material a script for a great play that was made into a near-perfect film beloved by almost everyone for its wit and immense, profound themes rendered accessible and moving, and for the fact that it had two of the most extraordinary performances ever committed to what may still then have been celluloid – well, you had better be pretty damn sure that you are bringing something new, exciting, different, richer, cleverer, even more illuminating to the table. Otherwise you are going to look like a bit of a berk.And so, my friends, to the new six-part drama Amadeus, about the life, death and music of Wolfgang A Mozart, one of the defining geniuses of the last 1,000 years of western history. Co-creators Joe Barton and Julian Farino have retained parts of Peter Shaffer’s 1979 play and the 1984 film starring Tom Hulce as Mozart and F Murray Abraham as his rival composer Antonio Salieri, reworked them into lesser forms, and surrounded them with lesser – flat, airless, banal – scenes. Shaffer’s driving interests in the corrupting power of envy, the survival of religious faith under duress, the mystery of talent and what we expect to come from genius are mostly reduced to pale, petty versions of themselves. The performances – well, we’ll come to those. Continue reading...</p>

Its unexplained removal on Saturday triggered a chorus of accusations from Democrats about evident political interference in favor of the president, a former friend of Epstein.
