The most significant event of the day will probably be the meeting that Keir Starmer is hosting in Downing Street for the E3 (the leaders of Britain, France and Germany), and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.There will be some mention of that here, but Jakub Krupa will be leading the coverage of that on his Europe live blog.50,000 young people across the country will be better equipped for jobs of the future through a major investment to create more apprenticeships and training courses.The £725m package of reforms to the apprenticeship system will help to tackle youth unemployment and drive economic growth, with thousands more young people expected to benefit over the next three years.A survey sent to local Labour parties, seen by The Times, prompted members to name the politicians who stood “the best chance of leading Labour to electoral victory at the next general election” compared with Starmer and to rank those they would be likely to vote for in a leadership election.Eight senior Labour politicians were named alongside Starmer. The five cabinet ministers in the survey are Wes Streeting, the health secretary; Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary; Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary; Ed Miliband, the energy secretary; and Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister.

Instead, working with non-professional actors and a story clearly premeditated enough to earn a credit for its authors (Kotevska and Suz Curtis), this blends folk tale, improvisation and mud-caked vérité to tell the story of a contemporary farming family, the Conevs, in economically depressed North Macedonia.Sixtysomething paterfamilias Nikola and his wife, Jana, have been growing watermelons, tomatoes and tobacco on the family land for years. However, the wholesale prices have recently dropped through the soil, prompting a mini riot by irate agricultural workers who take out their frustrations by destroying their own crops. Nikola and Jana’s daughter Ana decides to emigrate to Germany with her husband, taking their preschool-aged daughter with them, only to discover that most of their wages will be eaten up by childcare fees. They implore Jana to come out and be their childminder, leaving Nikola to try to sell the farmland for a pittance and find a job at a local landfill. Melancholy video-calls to the family abroad underscore his loneliness, but at least he has old mucker Ilija to talk to and share the odd bottle of hooch. Continue reading...</p>

Their bench included a £64m striker in Viktor Gyökeres, a trio of tricky wingers in Leandro Trossard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli and arguably England’s most exciting teenagers in Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri. But Arsenal arrived top-heavy, the only centre-back among the substitutes the 16-year-old Marli Salmon. By the time Emiliano Buendía clinched victory for Aston Villa with almost the final kick, it was clear Arsenal lacked the defensive solidity behind their pace-setting start; this defeat was only the fourth time since the start of 2022-23 that Mikel Arteta’s side began a league game without Gabriel Magalhães or William Saliba – and it showed. Cristhian Mosquera, potentially sidelined until the new year, was also absent. The good news for all parties – which probably extends to second-placed Manchester City – is that Arsenal and Villa will duke it out again on 30 December in the reverse fixture.

It is a strong antioxidant, helping protect cells from harmful unstable compounds that arise from toxins and pollution. It helps the body absorb iron, and is also used in the production of collagen. “But the idea that taking high doses of vitamin C – or drinking lots of orange juice – will stop you catching a cold, or help you recover faster, is a myth.”Davis, the author of Self Defence: A Myth-Busting Guide to Immune Health, explains that the popular belief in vitamin C’s cold-fighting powers has persisted for more than 50 years, “pretty much solely because of the evangelical view of one man: Linus Pauling”.

Our chance of salvaging something from the mess it created is being undermined by those selling false hope – either that Brexit can work, or that it can be easily undone. For the 16,000 businesses that have now given up trading with Europe because of paperwork, prospects remain bleak unless the government stops offering a sticking plaster and starts major surgery on our future with Europe.Forgive pro-Europeans for thinking the momentum is now with us. Labour has been slow to say what it wants from the EU reset, and slower still to acknowledge the inevitable tradeoffs required. Until the summer, ministers promised to “make Brexit work” and endlessly repeated “red lines”. Yet in recent weeks, a major study has found that leaving the EU cost the UK 6-8% of GDP per capita; now the chancellor calls the damage of Brexit “severe and long lasting”; the prime minister condemns the “wild promises” of the Leave campaign. Belatedly, a window of opportunity to change course may be opening.Stella Creasy is the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe and MP for Walthamstow Continue reading...</p>

You would expect one to cancel out the other, but here the narrative cracks forward with such certainty, you can afford the odd moment to laugh.It is funny that Baron Aaron (Tyler Collins) is deep in denial about his failed shipping business; that Beauty (Israela Efomi) carries with her a copy of an etiquette manual called How to Be a Lovely Young Lady; that her sister, Bright (Holly Howden Gilchrist), cares more for inventions than everyday expressions of affection; that the cat and dog (Michael Guest and Martin Donaghy) are falling ever so sweetly in love; and that the housekeeper Mrs Flobberlyboo (Elicia Daly) has a taste for modernist singing that makes the rest of Nikola Kodjabashia’s angular score seem conventional.

Rajiv Joseph explains why he brought the beast back from the dead for his Pulitzer-nominated dramaA play that dramatises the thoughts of a tiger on the bombed-out streets of Baghdad sounds outlandish. But Rajiv Joseph’s drama is rooted in a real incident during the invasion of Iraq. “I read the story,” he says, “that detailed how US bombs had blown open part of the zoo. The Bengal tiger had remained in its pen. All the zookeepers had fled, so this poor tiger was sitting there starving. One of the soldiers, who tried to feed it out of compassion, got his hand mauled. Another soldier shot and killed it.”It was 2003. The war was under way and Joseph, in his late 20s, was on a master’s programme at New York University. He took the tiger’s death as the starting point for a play with an absurdist kind of magical realism. After it is killed, the big cat returns as an anthropomorphic Dantean figure to interrogate the nature of God and the point of existence, all while padding around this hell on earth.

But first he praised God, saying in Spanish, “You saw the injustice and suffering, and in your infinite mercy you helped us.” Continue reading...</p>

Plus, Naomi Fry delivers a rich deep dive into The Doors’ legacyThe popular show’s two-part special on the Fab Four has, bizarrely, prompted its Beatles sceptic co-host Dominic Sandbrook to refuse to appear. But his mega-starry replacement is Conan O’Brien, in for an engaging chat with Tom Holland through the career of John, Paul, George and Ringo. Their USP? Says Holland: “We’re a history podcast rather than a music podcast so we need to make the case that the Beatles are significant historically.” Alexi DugginsWidely available Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Collateral comedy spins out from underneath the repression and violence charted in this sobering documentary that follows three indefatigable womenThere are many symptoms of totalitarian sickness gripping Alexander Lukashenko’s Belarus. You risk being arrested for wearing red and white together, the colours of the outlawed flag of the country’s opposition movement. Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four has been banned, which seems rather on the nose. But these are just some of the more farcical elements, the collateral comedy spinning from the deep repression, violence and psychological wounds charted in this sobering film that follows a trio of Belarusian activists, starting from the pandemic through to the invasion of Ukraine.Director Juliane Tutein fashions a melancholic mood-piece which chronicles ineffectualness in the face of impregnable state machinery, and the meaning of resistance under such circumstances. Nina, who is 74, is a kind of Belarusian Batman; an indefatigable symbol of protest who is immune to repression because of her fame. Human rights activist Darya runs her organisation in exile in Vilnius after student activism landed her in hot water. Tanya has stuck it out near Minsk while her husband and son have fled to Kyiv, but her human-rights NGO and film festival are in the authorities’ crosshairs. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">A meticulously researched account of the controversial businessman’s rise and shocking demiseAt least two terrible ironies surround the death of Mike Lynch. One lies in the name of his superyacht, which sank off the coast of Sicily in the early hours of 19 August 2024. He had named the boat Bayesian to honour Bayes’s theorem, a mathematical rule that helps you weigh up the probability of something given the available evidence, which served as Lynch’s guiding light over the course of a tempestuous career. The theorem was “a beautiful key to our minds”, Lynch believed. But it was entirely incapable of predicting the outcome that morning, when the yacht capsized during a storm, killing seven people, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter Hannah and his US lawyer, Chris Morvillo.A second irony lies in the fact that Lynch had just come through the trial of his life, one he felt was bound to end in jail, where he thought he could die. Somehow, to everyone’s astonishment, an American jury had acquitted him and his co-defendant on all 15 counts of fraud. Continue reading...</p>

Behind it, the mountains rise gently, their outlines caressed by the sun. The colours of autumn frame the 15th-century frescoes that embellish the structure’s interior, painted by Italian artist Aimone Duce, of the Lombard school. The chapel is the municipality’s oldest religious building, serving about 4,000 inhabitants, and stands on the site of a pre-existing building dating back to 1037.Inside the small chapel, my footsteps echo softly against the walls, breaking the stillness of the surrounding countryside. The sharp scent of plaster mingles with the earthy smell of the fields outside, carried in on the wind along with the sweetness of wheat. Light filters through the narrow windows, catching the vivid hues of a fresco that depicts the seven deadly sins – a theme often revisited in medieval iconography. Continue reading...</p>

The result was a national award for his pizza and a surprising surge in confidence When his kimchi fiorentina pizza won a national award, Rich Baker knew he was turning a corner. It was 2023. Baker was 60. He and his wife, Sarah, had made the kimchi themselves and their win put Flat Earth Pizzas, the east London restaurant they had launched the previous year, on the map. “My life has changed so much,” Baker says. “A lightbulb has lit up inside and given me energy, and that energy has given me something that is quite amazing: a sense of confidence and a sense of fulfilment.” Continue reading...</p>

A wise public would see red flags; instead it sees entertainmentOne upside of adversity is art, inspiring cultural output that seeks to process and channel suffering. “I’ll say one thing about Thatcher, some fantastic songs were written during her reign,” said the Irish singer Christy Moore once – before belting out a goosebump-raising rendition of Ordinary Man by Peter Hames, a song about the 1980s recession. That is, so far, the only upside of the publication of Olivia Nuzzi’s book American Canto, an affliction to journalism, politics and publishing: there has been some fantastic writing since it all kicked off.Masterful reviews. Very funny commentary. Scathing analysis. But first, a summary of events for readers of this column, most of whom I assume are well-adjusted, offline people, with better things to do with their time than follow what can only be described as a niche beef. Nuzzi is (or perhaps was, keep reading) a celebrated US political journalist who had a “digital affair” with Robert F Kennedy Jr while he was running for president, broke all sorts of journalistic rules while doing so, and was fired from her job at New York magazine. RFK Jr went on to become Donald Trump’s anti-vaccine health secretary, Nuzzi has published a book about the whole affair, and her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza – another political journalist – has been dripfeeding revelations about how she cheated on him, and a litany of other personal and professional transgressions.

Anything from a hard candy to a candied fruit can qualify as a “sugar plum” and, in the case of these cookies, the sugar plum is represented by the amarena cherry. Coffee’s bitterness balances the sweetness of the fruit and the rich butteriness of the dough, while the oat flour adds a dash of shortbread-like delicateness.Brian Levy is the author of the Formal Assignment newsletter and Good & Sweet, published by Avery at £35.99.

                    <p class="content-text">Q&A with Jörg Meyer, CCO, Zattoo Broadband TV News speaks with Jörg Meyer about the company’s new modular product architecture and how it redefines flexibility for operators in the streaming economy. Broadband TV News: Zattoo has restructured its B2B portfolio. Why now? Jörg Meyer: The market has shifted faster than most infrastructures. Linear and OTT are now fully converged in the eyes of consumers, but operators are often still bound to legacy systems. Our long-standing end-to-end platform delivered simplicity, but today’s landscape demands something more flexible. The move to a Composable TV Platform gives operators the ability to modernize incrementally, integrate what they already have, and remain agile without the disruption of a full rebuild. BTN: What exactly does “Composable TV” mean in practice? Meyer: It means designing the entire system for interoperability. Instead of one rigid platform, operators get modular building blocks – our new Zattoo Ingest, Zattoo Stream, and Zattoo Orchestrate modules – plus Zattoo End2End for those who still want a turnkey option. They can adopt a single module to address a specific challenge or combine several to scale strategically. It’s evolution without disruption. BTN: Talk us through the modules briefly. Meyer: Zattoo Ingest replaces the traditional headend with a fully managed, cloud-native setup that handles ingest, encoding, packaging, and other related capabilities – removing a huge CapEx load. Zattoo Stream is the delivery engine, complete with APIs, device SDKs, and server-side ad insertion that operators can use to launch hybrid and ad-supported models quickly. Zattoo Orchestrate is the control plane – the operational and commercial brain – managing product logic, metadata, analytics, personalization, and OSS/BSS integrations. And Zattoo End2End remains our proven ready-made solution, but now powered by the same modular architecture, now facilitating the integration of third-party solutions for selected parts of the overall TV platform. Together, these form the Zattoo Platform Suite, scaling from small ISPs to Tier-1 broadcasters. BTN: How does this differentiate Zattoo from other technology providers? Meyer: Many systems describe themselves as modular but are monolithic underneath. We’ve truly decoupled the business logic layer from the infrastructure layer, which means operators can plug in or replace components without committing to a full technology migration. It also changes the financial model: operators shift from fixed, upfront CapEx to flexible OpEx that aligns with real usage and subscriber growth. That’s essential in today’s economic reality. BTN: How does the new approach support monetization? Meyer: With Zattoo Stream, operators can roll out targeted advertising immediately through Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI), creating new revenue without new infrastructure. And with Zattoo Orchestrate, they can experiment with pricing tiers, ad-supported models, or upsells without engineering-heavy backend work. It shortens the distance between commercial ideas and commercial impact. BTN: How important is Zattoo’s European footprint in all this? Meyer: Extremely important. Today, we operate End2End IPTV platforms in ten European countries – I’m not aware of any company with a similar presence. Europe’s regulatory and linguistic diversity has shaped how we build and operate platforms. Our technology is built in Europe for Europe, but globally scalable, giving local operators the confidence to compete with international platforms while staying compliant and reliable. BTN: Partnerships seem central to your strategy. Meyer: They are. No single vendor can cover every layer of the stack anymore. Our open, API-first architecture supports co-innovation – whether with frontend partners, or with analytics and AI providers. Openness is fundamental to composability. BTN: What is Zattoo’s mission going forward? Meyer: To give operators back control – over technology choices, economics, and innovation speed. The future belongs to those who can orchestrate complexity instead of being overwhelmed by it. Our modular suite is built to make that possible.

                    <p class="content-text">We can move from defensive crouch to position of strength but only if we use the economic cards we have against US coercionEurope is on a trajectory towards nothing less than “civilisational erasure”, the Trump administration claims in its extraordinary new National Security Strategy, a document that blames European integration and “activities of the European Union that undermine political liberty and sovereignty” for some of the continent’s deepest problems.Everybody should have seen it coming after Washington’s humiliating 28-point plan for Ukraine. JD Vance’s shocking Munich speech in February, in which he suggested that Europe’s democracies were not worth defending was an early red flag. But the new words still land as a shock. The security document is the clearest signal yet of how brutally and transactionally Washington wants to engage with the continent. It marks another phase in Trump’s attempt to reshape Europe in his ideological image while at the same time abandoning it militarily.

His right eye, lost in an attack on a rebel observation post he was manning in 2012, is covered by yellow medical tape. Propped against the wall is a cane he uses to walk, after a rocket attack in 2014 left him with a limp.For 14 years, Ali dreamed of freedom and of justice. A year after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, he has his freedom but not his justice. The man he was dreaming of holding accountable – a member of his extended family who was a part of an Assad militia – had already fled the country by the time Ali returned to his home in Damascus.

You didn’t have to explain why this mattered,” said the 60-year-old Pruszko, as he refreshed those skills at an army base outside Warsaw on a recent frosty Saturday morning. With dozens of other Polish civilians, he toured a bomb shelter, fitted gas masks and practised striking sparks from a flint to start a fire. Continue reading...</p>

Making Cover-Up, a film about his astonishing life and countless scoops, was never going to be easyOne morning last month, Seymour Hersh set off to buy a newspaper. The reporter walked for 30 minutes, covered six blocks of his neighbourhood, Georgetown in Washington DC, and didn’t see a single sign of life. No newsstands on street corners selling the glossies and the dailies. No self-service kiosk where you can slide in a dollar and pull out a paper. “Finally, I found a drugstore that had two copies of the New York Times in the back,” Hersh recalls. He bought one for himself. He can’t help but wonder whether anybody bought the second.Hersh was born in Chicago in 1937, the year the Hindenburg airship blew up and the aviator Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific. That makes him a man of hot metal, the media’s ancient mariner, with metaphorical newsprint on his fingers and a cuttings file that reads like an index of American misadventure. Hersh has been a staff writer at the New York Times and the New Yorker. He’s broken stories on Vietnam, Watergate, Gaza and Ukraine. But the free press is in crisis, newspapers are in flux and investigative journalism may be facing a deadline of its own. “I don’t think I could do now what I did 30, 40, 50 years ago,” says the now 88-year-old. “The outlets aren’t there. The money’s not there. So I don’t know where we all are right now.” Continue reading...</p>

Now, as her renaissance continues, she is taking on Mrs Malaprop in The RivalsAfter six decades as an actor, Patricia Hodge says she still gets nervous before a play opens. “I think nerves are always the fear of the unknown,” she says. “Particularly with comedy, where there is no knowing how the audience will react: you’ve got to surf that.”We meet on a sunny winter morning at the Orange Tree theatre in Richmond, south-west London, where Hodge is about to appear in The Rivals, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Richard B Sheridan play, in which she plays the ironic – sorry, iconic – Mrs Malaprop. “You’re sort of in a tunnel, your entire being is focused on this,” she says. She was here in rehearsals until 11pm the night before. Today, she is sitting at a table with a large coffee. Does she enjoy this bit, the putting together of a play? “I think it’s love-hate actually. The process is really why I do theatre.” She says she finds it energising, “but it’s also very trying, and you just don’t want to be left with your own limitations”. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">They may have greeted each other with a giant bear hug before kick-off but Marco Silva must be sick of facing Oliver Glasner. After suffering two defeats to them here in the space of five weeks earlier in the year, the Fulham manager could only watch on in horror as Marc Guéhi’s late header sealed another victory for Crystal Palace that moved them into the top four.Glasner has made no secret of his dissatisfaction with Palace’s business in the summer having beaten Fulham on their way to winning the FA Cup and he was without the influential Daniel Muñoz for this trip to west London.

                    <p class="content-text">A brilliantly human photographer, he celebrated the overlooked, finding beauty in cheese sandwiches at a church fete or people queuing for ice cream at the beach – all while poking fun at Britishness• Martin Parr dies aged 73• Martin Parr: the photographer’s career in picturesMartin Parr looked like “a naff birdwatcher”, according to his editor Wendy Jones. His appearance was so unassuming that he told me during a recent public talk, that while he was taking pictures during a recent seaside trip, some passersby remarked that he was “a bit like Martin Parr”. Unbothered by glitz and glamour, for more than five decades Parr purposefully pursued the most boring things he could find – he was unapologetic about the excitement he saw in a perfect cup of tea, a plate of beans on toast, or a woman filling up her car at a petrol station. He also knew that, with time, these supposedly dull things would become interesting.Parr took delight in looking, without flattery, at the things you thought you already knew. In a Parr picture, beauty is not always graceful – the overflowing rubbish at New Brighton beach, the cucumber and cheese sandwiches wrapped in clingfilm at Shalfleet church fete (with the sign, please do take ONE cherry tomato). He made the mundane magnificent with his panache for saturated colours and surprising compositions. He was masterful at capturing the unexpected and unchoreographed interruptions that reveal the unpolished truth of the ordinary moment. He understood that the fluorescent glow of a chip shop could be as revealing as a cathedral; that the colour of a plastic beach bucket could anchor the entire mood of a nation; that the way a stranger holds a sandwich or an ice-cream speaks of class, of longing, of place, of the small stories that batter or buoy us daily. This radical attentiveness – this celebration of the overlooked – is what made Parr one of the most human photographers of our time. Continue reading...</p>

Israeli military operations continue to displace hundreds of families in Gaza. Aid has increased but Israel is still blocking vital supplies. Palestinians desperately require security, humanitarian relief and reconstruction. But they need and expect a political horizon too. Donald Trump’s plans make only the vaguest and most conditional reference to a Palestinian state, and Israelis – as well as their ultra-right government – have entrenched their opposition since the atrocities of 7 October 2023. Yet after two years of annihilation, Palestinian nationhood has won international support that many thought unimaginable.The political fate of Palestinians is bound to the personal fate of Marwan Barghouti. After more than two decades in an Israeli jail for murder, the charismatic 66-year-old is by far the most popular Palestinian leader, widely regarded as the only figure capable of uniting factions riven by ideology and enmity. Though a member of Fatah, Mr Barghouti has criticised abuses by the Palestinian Authority and has won respect within Hamas ranks. He has led Palestinian prisoners, while the PA’s old guard are seen as self-serving, ineffective, unaccountable and essentially as security contractors for Israel in the West Bank.

Pouring rain, a revolting support and a rejuvenated Hearts formed the backdrop. In the here and now, this was another alarming spectacle for anybody of Celtic inclination. Kieran Tierney’s stoppage-time goal should do nothing to mask how unimpressive Celtic were in a game of supposedly high stakes.On the previous occasion when Celtic played Hearts, Brendan Rodgers was still in office.

Plus letters from Vicky Mills and Kit JacksonJonathan Liew’s article (Won’t somebody please think of Britain’s poor £2m homeowners? Oh, wait – everyone already is, 2 November) entirely misses the point that underlies the spate of criticism against the “mansion tax”. While wealth disparity is no doubt an issue that needs to be addressed, this tax is a spiteful assault on hard-working taxpayers who already pay an enormous proportion of their salary to the Treasury to support a woefully mismanaged public sector and welfare state. Those who support the tax seem to be driven by a simple ideology that we need to “bash the rich” to create equality.In the real world, this tax penalises hard-working families who have made difficult choices and made huge sacrifices to get to where they are. I come from a working-class background, I worked hard at school and achieved good grades, I worked part-time jobs, paid my own way through university and chose a profession that pays well, relocating to London and making sacrifices to earn good money – spending 18 hours a day in the office – and I chose to buy property and invest in it. I did not enjoy annual holidays or a defined-benefit pension that others enjoy. Continue reading...</p>

These aren’t just socioeconomic – they have a huge impact on our health, wellbeing and how long we live.This harsh truth is nowhere clearer than in my constituency, Leeds Central and Headingley, which has the widest life expectancy gap in England based on data from Health Equals. Residents in the Hyde Park area are expected to live a shocking 14 years less than those in neighbouring Far Headingley and Weetwood. A half-hour walk takes you from one area to the other – equating to more than a decade of life lost. Continue reading...</p>

But a new edition has made his final thoughts on his opera performable again, and Opera Rara and the BBC Symphony Orchestra got to do the big reveal.The standard version of La Rondine, performed at the premiere in 1917, ends with Magda – the “migrating swallow” of the title – nobly leaving her lovelorn Ruggero so that he can find someone more marriageable. Yet Puccini’s 1921 revision – his third version of the opera, the one he was finally happy with – has Ruggero angrily sending Magda away. It’s a big change, making the opera’s aftertaste bitter where it used to be sweet. There are lots of other differences too, notably some extra merrymaking for the chorus and orchestra in the second act. Continue reading...</p>

Their loving and feuding was spread across nine books and set against more than four decades of British history.Unlike Downton, the story features just the upstairs lot. They have come a long way from their Dorset farming descendants and are not the best sort of people: they hold money paramount with a need to “possess things”. Adapted by Shaun McKenna and Lin Coghlan, who previously adapted the story for radio, we see how this entitlement manifests in love, marriage and betrayal. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Egyptian’s calculated outburst is a challenge to management and their support for embattled Arne SlotMohamed Salah’s relationship with Liverpool is broken. That is abundantly clear after the incendiary interview at Elland Road on Saturday night that also poses a test of the club’s relationship with Arne Slot. The next revelation will be the extent of internal support for the coach who delivered Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th league title eight months ago.Salah may have been emotional having been benched for the third successive game, but stunning waiting reporters not only by stopping to speak but by dropping a series of grenades during a post-match interview lasting more than seven minutes was not a case of heart ruling head. It never is when one of the greatest players to pull on the red shirt deigns to address the media. Whether it is criticism of contract negotiations, applying a little more pressure to get an agreeable deal done or, in this instance, piling more problems on Slot, Salah’s words are calculated to achieve what he wants.

                    <p class="content-text">Unusually devoid of creativity, Brighton had found themselves imprisoned within Nuno Espírito Santo’s tactical cage, falling right into his hands. Jarrod Bowen, so often West Ham’s talisman, scored the goal, executing the masterplan from the narrowest of angles, perfectly executing the counterattacking strategy. Slowly but surely, still staring demotion in the face, Nuno’s team look capable of fighting their way to safety. His plan had come together so well that Bowen’s goal was supplied by a substitute in Callum Wilson, on the field for just 51 seconds. His masterplan fell short when the Amex, the home of late goals, staged yet another comeback, Georginio Rutter roofing the equaliser amid the type of madcap scramble that is commonplace at Brighton.Before a late surge that had seemed wholly beyond them, Brighton could not muster a shot on target. Their ambitions of returning to the European stage they graced in the 2023-24 season are being hindered by inconsistency. West Ham were in Europe that season, too, though horizons are lowered. Leeds’ form has deepened relegation worries and they were denied the three points they needed to close the gap by Rutter’s equaliser. Continue reading...</p>

I hope the universe has repaid her many times overRead more in the kindness of strangers seriesBack in 2006, I went to Canberra for a medical school interview. I figured I would book accommodation when I arrived but when I arrived, there was a big convention in town and all the backpackers hostels and budget accommodation were fully booked.Coming from Singapore, I thought perhaps I could just sleep at the airport – but quickly found Canberra airport, unlike Singapore’s, is not open 24 hours. Not knowing quite what to do and getting a bit desperate, I caught a bus into town, then started wandering towards the casino, thinking I might spend the night in a place that was open all night. That wouldn’t put me in the ideal condition for nailing an interview the next morning, but as a broke student, I couldn’t afford a pricey hotel. Continue reading...</p>

With Christmas deliveries arriving thick and fast, here are practical steps to takeA couple of years ago, 31-year-old charity worker Nicki Wedgwood had ordered Christmas presents online for friends and family. When the packages were delivered to her in Hackney, east London, the driver left them in the lobby of her building rather than taking them directly to her flat. She spotted them as she popped out to a nearby shop and decided to pick them up when she came back. When she returned 10 minutes later, the boxes had been ripped open and their contents were gone.Wedgwood thinks she passed the thief in the hallway as she was leaving for the shop. “There was some random dude just inside the doorway, who had a Boris bike with him,” she says. She had assumed he was a guest of one of her neighbours. “I said hello to him … I think he even said Merry Christmas.” Continue reading...</p>

If a peace deal includes two key elements, it should acceptThe negotiations over the war in Ukraine are frustrating and tragic. On the one side, a victim of aggression whose plight is more and more desperate. On the other, a brutal aggressor, willing to go to extraordinary lengths to win the war. In the middle, a transactional American president eager for a deal.It’s no surprise that so many observers have railed against the proposals recently put forward by President Donald Trump and his emissary Steve Witkoff. These proposals appear to offer much to Russia and little to Ukraine – other than an end to the violence. If the negotiations produce a plan that offers Ukraine no hope of security after the war, no Ukrainian leader will accept it. Security is the core of sovereignty, and it would be political suicide to trade Ukraine’s sovereignty for peace.Christopher S Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the American statecraft program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Continue reading...</p>

The test should instead ask about soap operas and sandwichesWhat medal did Mary Peters win in the 1972 Olympics? How many Scottish ski resorts are there? Where was Florence Nightingale born? Until I got these questions as exasperated screenshots from my husband, I had no idea, like any normal Briton (it’s gold, five and Italy, apparently). They came from an app he downloaded to revise for his Life in the UK test, a prerequisite for applying for citizenship. Other recent questions have featured the divine right of kings, Hadrian’s Wall fort names and trying minor crimes in Scotland. Can the test itself possibly be this hard? We’ll soon find out: he’s taking it next week, if he doesn’t give up and go back to France instead.Much has been written about the absurdity of the Life in the UK test – it’s inaccurate, partial and sloppily worded, unfit for purpose, a “bad pub quiz” – and now it’s ruining my life (in the UK). Home is tense: my husband is tetchy because he has spent years here (he works, volunteers, pays taxes, can identify both Mitchell brothers and responds appropriately when asked “You all right?”), but now needs to prove he is assimilated by answering multiple-choice questions on the repeal of the Corn Laws. I’m mortified, partly because we’re making people pay £50 to take an absurdly hard exam – you need 75% to pass – and partly because it keeps humbling me. I’m a history graduate, but couldn’t tell you the date of the Habeas Corpus Act with a gun to my head. Continue reading...</p>

Ready for some math?The entire Media Universe was atwitter this weekend, around the breathless breaking news that Netflix had won the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal worth at least $82.7 billion.For the purposes of this essay, let’s put a pin in the facts that this deal will not close until 3Q 2026 at the absolute soonest, and that (as I said Friday) there is a an excellent chance this deal never even closes. Instead, today, let’s all focus only on the viability of the deal itself, assuming it comes to fruition.Some will say it’s hard to predict how this deal might turn out. To that I say: Bullshit. We have a motion-picture-perfect case study to gauge how this merger will play out - the Disney acquisition of FOX in 2019. There are myriad reasons why these deals are uber-appropriate comps: The prices are similar; the acquisition targets are almost identical; the need-case of the buyers are eerily alike; the post-deal debt loads are comparably monumental; and the strategic imperatives of all four companies involved bear striking resemblances.

It’s a handy edict for anyone adapting the many moralising, terrifying and bizarre episodes within Carlo Collodi’s 1883 novel. Charlie Josephine and Jim Fortune’s new family musical takes heed, barreling out of the blocks to cover an impressive chunk of Collodi’s story while swapping its darkness and finger-wagging for heartwarming lessons and boisterous humour.In a narrow-minded Italian town (hammily chorused “mamma mias!” kick off the blissful silliness to come), free-thinking inventor Geppetto is an outcast. His ticket to adventure arrives as a piece of talking wood, which he plans to craft into a fortune-winning puppet. Pinocchio, of course, has other ideas. But here, the puppet’s journey to boyhood isn’t just about learning what makes us good, but what makes us human. His scrapes along the way are born not out of wickedness but curiosity and impulsive energy – perfectly captured by the three puppeteers animating Peter O’Rourke’s simple wooden design (including Lee Braithwaite, who gives Pinocchio a voice wild and wonder-filled), and by Josephine’s book, which sees Pinocchio firing off life’s big questions only to interrupt the answers with yells of “I’m hungry!” Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Thankfully, we now know more about conditions such as autism and ADHD. The health secretary must not be part of this attempt to turn back the clockWes Streeting is a politician whose keen interest in the zeitgeist is only matched by his seeming drive to be as close to the heart of it as possible. It is, therefore, not much of a surprise that the secretary of state for health and social care should end the year by announcing what the official blurb calls an “independent review into mental health conditions, ADHD and autism”. Many of the resulting headlines put it more pithily: in keeping with an increasingly deafening media din, this will seemingly be an investigation into “overdiagnosis”.Candidates for 2025’s word of the year have so far included “rage bait” and “parasocial”, but overdiagnosis is surely the term that perfectly captures the intellectual and political fashions of the past 12 months. The mess of ideas it crystallises now has a set text, published back in March: The Age Of Diagnosis by the neurologist and epilepsy expert Dr Suzanne O’Sullivan. Having been pronounced on, with his usual belligerent ignorance, by Nigel Farage, overdiagnosis has become an obsession of the Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice, who now holds forth about why some children with special educational needs shouldn’t be entitled to dedicated school transport, and claims that the sight of kids with sensory issues wearing ear defenders at school is “insane”.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Our in-house perfectionist tries all the fiddly bits for you …If you’re asking what on earth chocolate has to do with a city with an average annual temperature of 28C, then you must have been stuck in the desert for the past three years. Because, since its creation in the UAE in 2022, apparently to satisfy chocolatier Sarah Hamouda’s pregnancy cravings for pistachio and pastry, this bar has taken over the world. Though food (among those with the luxury of choice, at least) has never been immune to the absurdities of fashion, the internet has supercharged and globalised the process, so much so that pistachios, which back in January were dubbed “the new pumpkin spice” by this very newspaper, are now everywhere, from Starbucks lattes to Aldi mince pies.The thing is, however, that whatever your thoughts on green, sugary, coffee-adjacent beverages, Hamouda’s Dubai chocolate developed for Fix Dessert Chocolatier has triumphed, because it really does taste as good as it looks: crunchy pastry, sweet chocolate and rich, slightly savoury nut butter are an incredibly satisfying combination, so a big bar of it is guaranteed to impress under the Christmas tree. Experience demands that I suggest you wrap it in a pet-proof box, however – emergency vet bills are no one’s idea of a great present. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">This year’s most-wanted ornaments include weight-loss syringes and favourite foodstuffs. When and why did Christmas trees become so commercialised?it was the second Tuesday in November but Christmas was already in crisis. Sarah Gibbons had just received a shipment of baubles at her Glasgow homeware shop, Modern Love Store, and some crucial ornaments were missing. She hopped on a long-distance phone call to her suppliers in the US – she needed to sort this out. After all, her customers were clamouring for them. “People aren’t just buying one,” the 39-year-old shopkeeper told me after discovering the missing decorations, “they’re buying three or four at a time.” Three what? Turtle doves? Nutcrackers? Or perhaps some classic candy canes? Of course not. This year’s must-have bauble is in the shape of a lightly glittered syringe of Ozempic.Growing up, my favourite Christmas ornament was a little pink plastic baby Jesus resting in a manger. He was bought by my great-aunt in Oberammergau, Germany, in 1990 – and although his battery hasn’t been changed since, you can still press his belly to hear Silent Night play. Today, decorations are a little different. Ozempic isn’t the only needle hanging from our needles: Britons can also purchase Christmas tree ornaments shaped like syringes of Botox and filler. Meanwhile, Selfridges is selling a dirty martini bauble, M&S is peddling a hanging prawn cocktail and Aldi is offering an ornament shaped like an air fryer. Move over, baby Jesus; glass has now been blown into the likeness of Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and The Bear’s Jeremy Allen White. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Over the last 50 years, cabbage consumption in Britain has declined 80%. But it’s versatile, full of vitamins, and perfect on a winter night. Here’s how to make the most of itIt’s not good news: despite a lot of messaging about healthy eating, Britons consume 12% less vegetables per week than they did in 1974, when the government’s Family Food survey began. And while the consumption of some specific vegetables – courgettes, say – has risen over the past 50 years, others have experienced a sharp decline. Among the biggest losers is cabbage. Cabbage consumption in the UK dropped by 80%, beaten only by brussels sprouts (87%) which are, after all, a kind of cabbage.This is a tragedy, not just because cabbage is an unsung superfood containing essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, as well as protein and dietary fibre, but because it’s a flexible, abundant and potentially delicious culinary ingredient. It even comes in different colours. Continue reading...</p>

A new wave of party pleasers, trick takers and strategy games can transport you to Stalingrad, the spirit realm, or even Georgian sex venues There was a time when playing a Christmas board game meant dusting off an old favourite selected from a narrow range of options. Maybe Trivial Pursuit, if you wanted to show off your pub quiz chops. Or Scrabble, if you felt like flexing your wordsmith muscles. Or Monopoly, if you hoped to roll around in wads of fake cash. But these days the choice is far, far wider. Almost overwhelmingly so.During the past decade, the modern board game scene has exploded like a cartoon kitten. As screens have come to dominate our eyelines and erode our mental health, more of us are seeking recreational solace in the more social, less toxic worlds of cardboard, cubes and wooden pawns – or “meeples”, to use the hobby parlance. Each tabletop experience has been finely crafted to yield maximum enjoyment in an often gorgeously presented way. Taking their cue from such indefatigable “Eurogame” classics as Catan and Codenames, these modern games have so grown in popularity they’ve encouraged the spread of high-street board game cafes, fuelled a boom in tabletop-related influencer activity, filled convention halls at ever-growing expos worldwide and raised millions on crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter.

My nan sent me and my cousin to pick up some bits in Dalston and there was some change left over so I went into HMV and bought this CD for £1.99. I shouldn’t have been stealing my nan’s change but I felt so grownup. If my Jamaican dad had found out, he wouldn’t have been happy. I would have got a couple of licks.The song I inexplicably know every lyric to Mambo No 5 (A Little Bit of …) by Lou Bega. I was working on my album recently and realised I knew every word.

Vladimir Putin is systematically ruining his country. His war of choice in Ukraine is an economic, financial, geopolitical and human calamity for Russia that worsens by the day.

                    <p class="content-text">After several attempts at eating ‘out’, I’m still on the fenceChristmas dinner? At home or in a restaurant? It’s at this juncture of the year, with Christmas dinner hurtling towards us, that you may well find yourself muttering: “Well, we could always go out!” Who could blame any home cook for wanting to shove this great burden on to someone else’s back, especially since every culinary TV show, magazine article and advertising break since mid-November has hammered home what a colossal faff Christmas dinner actually is. No, it’s not just a slightly posh Sunday roast with a few more guests.Christmas dinner in the UK these days is more like a cross between dinner at Balmoral and 4 July at Mar-a-Lago. The table has to be heaving with holly-embossed crockery, the carrots must be bejewelled in star anise and Himalayan pink pepper, the turkey has to be brined in aromatic salt water and your roasties shaken in polenta and smothered in duck fat. If you’re the designated martyr organising proceedings, field-marshalling everything and cooking this tinsel-strewn palaver, it is common to try instead to divert it all to the local pub, where they’re doing “turkey and all the trimmings” for £79 a head (and including a cracker and a pre-dinner “glass of something sparkly”). After several attempts at spending Christmas “out”, however, I’m still on the fence as to whether or not it’s really worth it. Chances are, if you’re the designated cook, as I often am, you’ll also find yourself equally burdened as the designated table-finder, taxi-booker and exasperated berk trying to get Aunt Agnes up to the Queen’s Head by 3pm, mainly because she won’t on any account miss the king’s speech, won’t eat turkey without bread sauce and would ideally like her Jim Reeves cassette played over the pub’s sound system.

A couple of months on from winning the Rugby Union World Cup with her England teammates, she’s still on a high. I ask if she slept with her winner’s medal by her bed the night they won. “That night?” She gives me a look. “It’s still by my bed. Every day. I wake up and the medal’s next to my bed. And it’s, like, as if!”But Kildunne is not resting on her laurels. She says the medal is also a reminder of what’s left to achieve – for her, and for women’s rugby in general. “Your heart’s telling you that you’ve done it, but I need to refocus. So it’s about how can we win the prem, how can we win another Six Nations, more World Cups? How can we keep fans coming to games? We’ve sold out Twickenham, so how do we do it again?” Continue reading...</p>

Now as Netflix plans a landscape-changing takeover of Warner Bros, he’s in the middle of an even bigger one.Zaslav, or Zaz, is a hard-charging, well-connected executive who cut his teeth inside NBC, and ascended into New York’s media elite as he transformed Discovery Inc from a nature- and science-focused cable broadcaster into a reality TV giant.

                    <p class="content-text">In the snowy mountains of Grövelsjön, visitors can get a rare glimpse into a little-known traditional way of life – and sleep in a tipi under the starsOn the summit of a snow-covered hill, two men sit on a patch of lichen, their backs against their snowmobiles. They are wearing thick padded clothing and hats with ear covers. One is scanning the valley with binoculars, the other is checking their drone. “We’ve got a speaker on it to play various calls. Thermal imaging helps. The dogs do the rest.” The younger of the two men, Elvjin, pours out tots of strong coffee for everyone. “The main job at this time of year is to keep the herd up here where we can see them,” he says. “When they start calving, the danger from bears, wolverines and eagles increases. We need to see them.”If I had a mental picture of reindeer herding before arriving here in the mountains of western Sweden, it certainly did not involve drones and thermal imaging. But that is the aim of this trip: to see an authentic and little-known European way of life, which for centuries suffered repression and abuse, only to be swiftly cannibalised into tourist-trap Santa experiences – all sleigh bells and traditional embroidery.

                    <p class="content-text">This documentary on the musician interviews everyone from Flea to … Rowan Williams. It’s a thoughtful take on his songs and ChristianityDevouring the new Nick Cave documentary on Sky, I am reminded how critics go wild for arty musicians who constantly change direction and dabble in everything. This is its own kind of myth. I know plenty of artists who keep moving – one week they’re sewing fish scales on to jackets, the next they’re painting mirrors or putting seahorses in samovars. The problem is, no one cares. If poet and ceramicist Nick Cave didn’t also write classic songs, he’d just be a local weirdo. I definitely wouldn’t buy a hardcover transcription of conversations he’d had with a mate about God. I’m glad I did, though.The documentary, Nick Cave’s Veiled World (Saturday 6 December, 9pm, Sky Arts), is timed to promote the TV adaptation of his filthy novel The Death of Bunny Munro. It’s a glorious opportunity to revisit his early, intense masterpieces: electric chair confessionals, murderous duets with pop princesses, profane love songs. They’re still in my head, days later. It’s also a reminder that, in a joyfully perverse career, the assertion of his Christian faith has been his most divisive move. Audiences love biblical imagery in rock songs, provided the singer doesn’t actually believe. Continue reading...</p>

Other elder statesmen publishing this year included Salman Rushdie with The Eleventh Hour (Cape), a playful quintet of mortality-soaked short stories and his first fiction since the 2022 assault that blinded him in his right eye; while Ian McEwan was also considering endings and legacy in What We Can Know (Cape), in which a 22nd-century literature scholar looks back, from the other side of apocalypse, on a close-knit group of (mostly) fictional literary lions from our own era. In a time of climate terror, the novel is both a fascinating wrangle with the limits of what humans are able to care about – from bare survival, to passion and poetry, to the enormity of environmental disaster – and a poignant love letter to the vanishing past.But perhaps the most eagerly awaited return this year was another global figure: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, whose first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count (4th Estate), follows the lives of four interconnected women between Nigeria and the US. Taking in love, motherhood and female solidarity as well as privilege, inequality and sexual violence, it’s a rich and beautifully composed compendium of women’s experience. Continue reading...</p>

Like, there’s a lot of history there, between the two countries. Like, there’s a lot going on.”Today, people are more knowledgable about the history of the English in Ireland. Coughlan is happy about that. She’s also happy about the explosion of Irish storytelling in popular culture – Normal People, Trespasses, Small Things Like These, not to mention the series that made her name, Derry Girls. And she’s proud of young Irish actors – Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan and Lola Petticrew, to name a few. She listens to bands such as Fontaines DC, CMAT and Kneecap. “It’s such a small country and the amount of creativity that comes out of Ireland is really extraordinary.” Continue reading...</p>

Which, much like spotting Mars in the night sky or visiting the pyramids of Egypt, makes me feel hugely insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but simultaneously awe-inspired by the power of a simple biscuit to provide joy and underpin celebrations across centuries. This particular recipe belongs to my friend Friede’s grandma, Hadmuth, and is worth continuing, I think, for at least another 500 years. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The Bundesliga has entered the UK and Irish markets with a dedicated FAST Channel on Samsung TV Plus, offering free live and on-demand coverage of Germany’s top football leagues. The channel marks the league’s first foray into Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV in the region and forms part of a multi-year partnership between the Bundesliga and Samsung TV Plus. The move expands the league’s footprint at a time when interest in German football is rising, especially as England’s captain Harry Kane continues to make waves in the league ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026. Viewers will be able to watch all Friday-night Bundesliga fixtures live, beginning with tonight’s match between Mainz and Borussia Mönchengladbach (19:30 GMT). The service will also carry one live Bundesliga 2 match in each kick-off slot throughout the weekend. Beyond live games, the channel will run 24/7 with highlights, classic matches, documentaries, press conferences, behind-the-scenes features and extensive archive material from one of the sport’s largest media libraries. “With a Bundesliga channel on Samsung TV Plus, we’re taking another step in how the Bundesliga can be experienced in the UK: free, live and closer than ever before. This launch shows that the Bundesliga doesn’t just talk about innovation – we deliver it,” said Peer Naubert, CEO of Bundesliga International. Samsung TV Plus, available subscription-free on Samsung TVs, Galaxy devices and Samsung Smart Monitors, hosts the channel with technical distribution support from Wurl, a FAST platform service provider. According to Bundesliga, the partnership forms part of a broader strategy to expand its digital presence and increase accessibility for international fans.</p>

For example, someone could ask the AI platform to generate a song about a boozy night out in the style of a Britpop band, and it would draw on songs with similar sounds and themes to create its own.

He denies betting on his own teamsTony Bloom, the billionaire owner of Brighton & Hove Albion FC, is facing questions over claims he was an anonymous gambler behind $70m (£52m) in winnings – which allegedly included bets on his football teams.Bloom – one of the world’s most successful professional gamblers – is claimed to be the “John Doe” referred to in a US legal case that tried to unmask who has benefited from the lucrative winning streak.Following publication Bloom issued a statement through Brighton FC: “I can categorically assure our supporters that I have not placed bets on any Brighton & Hove Albion matches since becoming the owner of the club in 2009. In 2014, in addition to new rules on betting, The FA introduced a policy with quite onerous provisions for owners of football clubs with interests in betting. These provisions allow certain football club owners, including me, to continue to bet on football under strict conditions.In particular, the policy prevents me from betting on any match or competition that Brighton & Hove Albion is involved in. Since 2014, I have always fully complied with these conditions, and all of my bets on football are audited by one of the world’s leading accounting firms on an annual basis to ensure full compliance with The FA’s policy.” Continue reading...</p>

They are a party in a bag, ideal paired with a glass of something sparkling or a cocktail, and wonderful swiped through a dip or topped with something bougie, such as caviar.As a self-confessed crisp addict, and as someone who would sometimes swerve a gourmet dinner for the company of a bowl filled with fried potato pleasure, I jumped at the chance to taste-test festive flavours for the Filter, examining an ever-growing market in which crisp tycoons try to outdo each other with nostalgic flavours.

Unfortunately for me, this was the day Spotify released “Spotify Wrapped”, its analysis of (in my case) the 4,863 minutes I had spent listening to music on its platform over the past year.

Now it’s out, all the drama surrounding it seems superfluousOn 25 November, award-winning Italian developer Santa Ragione, responsible for acclaimed titles such as MirrorMoon EP and Saturnalia, revealed that its latest project, Horses, had been banned from Steam - the largest digital store for PC games.

In Pelly’s account, the music streaming giant views music as a kind of nondescript sonic wallpaper, artists as an unnecessary encumbrance to the business of making more money and its target market not as music fans, but mindless drones who don’t really care what they’re listening to, ripe for manipulation by its algorithm. Sharp business practices and evidence of its deleterious effect on the quality and variety of new music abound: the worst thing is that Pelly can’t really come up with a viable alternative in a world where convenience trumps all.Men of a Certain Age: My Encounters With Rock RoyaltyKate Mossman (Bonnier) There’s no doubt that Men of a Certain Age is a hard sell, a semi-autobiographical book in which the New Statesman’s arts editor traces her obsession with often wildly unfashionable, ageing male artists – Queen’s Roger Taylor, Bruce Hornsby, Steve Perry of Journey, Jon Bon Jovi among them – through a series of interviews variously absurd, insightful, hair-raising and weirdly touching. But it’s elevated to unmissable status by Mossman’s writing, which is so sparkling, witty and shrewd that your personal feelings about her subjects are rendered irrelevant amid the cocktail of self-awareness, affection and sharp analysis she brings to every encounter. In a world of music books retelling tired legends, Men of a Certain Age offers that rare thing: an entirely original take on rock history. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Hispasat and Portuguese operator NOS have renewed their multi-year agreement for satellite TV distribution across Portugal, including the Azores and Madeira, extending a DTH partnership that has been in place for more than 20 years. Under the new contract, Hispasat will continue to use capacity from its 30° West orbital position to deliver NOS’s satellite platform, carrying more than 100 national and international TV channels. The service underpins universal TV coverage for NOS, reaching homes in rural and hard-to-serve areas where terrestrial reception is limited. NOS says satellite remains essential to “deliver everything to everyone” in Portugal, with DTH subscribers still concentrated in less densely populated regions where it can guarantee signal stability and quality. Hispasat describes the renewal as reinforcing a “strategic relationship” in the Iberian market. Joao Ferreira, director at NOS, said the operator’s audiovisual offer has relied on Hispasat “for decades” and that the renewed agreement ensures it can continue to provide service “even in the most remote areas”. Hispasat CCO Ignacio Sanchis called it “a great satisfaction” to retain NOS’s trust for its DTH services.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Portuguese pay-TV broadcaster Sport TV has secured rights to show every match from the FIFA World Cup 2026, committing to live coverage of all 104 games, 70 of them on an exclusive basis. The sports network will be the only subscription-TV channel in Portugal to carry the full tournament, which runs from 11 June to 19 July 2026 in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Sport TV says it will show every game from the group phase through to the final, with a World Cup-focused schedule running for the full 39 days of competition. Flagship channel SPORT.TV1 will switch to a dedicated World Cup format, carrying 92 live matches and close to 1,000 hours of coverage, including studio programming around Portugal’s national team. The remaining 12 fixtures will be shown on SPORT.TV2, with additional content and highlights offered across the broadcaster’s seven-channel line-up and digital platforms. Local reports indicate that 34 of the 104 matches will also air free-to-air in Portugal, in line with past tournaments where games involving the national team and key knockout ties have been sublicensed to terrestrial broadcasters. Pay-TV exclusivity will therefore apply to 70 fixtures, primarily outside Portugal’s matches and the highest-profile games. Sport TV chief executive Nuno Ferreira Pires said the deal extends a World Cup relationship that goes back more than two decades and described the 2026 edition as “special”, with expectations high around another deep run for Portugal in what could be the last World Cup for several star players. Sport TV’s acquisition follows FIFA’s 2024 invitation to tender for rights in Portugal and sits alongside a separate package awarded to LiveMode, which is understood to be preparing digital and YouTube coverage of part of the tournament. The combination reinforces Sport TV’s position as the leading premium football outlet in the market while ensuring broad distribution of selected matches via free platforms.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Hi Peaceniks! A special BREAKING NEWS edition today.Let’s all stop pretending that David Zaslav or the WBD board gives any shits about their shareholders, employees, or consumers. They do not.Last week, I broke down the core motivations of Big Media C-Suites, as they make obviously terrible decisions that’ve destroyed Mainstream Media:Greed and Ego.This week, the power elite of the Big Media Industrial Complex have done everything possible to prove my thesis.SEE: Warner Bros. Discovery. The merger that created WBD (aka Disco Bros) was based on ZERO strategy. It was driven (exclusively) by lawyers and bankers in Zaslav and Malone’s ears, telling them what big deals it would make them and HOW MUCH money it would make them.SEE: Nepo Prince Ellison’s silly bid to buy WBD. The WBD merger should be enough of a cautionary tale to warn off this BIGGER version of the same SHITTY concept. But Mr. Silver Spoon and Daddy Oligarch ONLY see the power it buys them.SEE: The public, moronic pissing match between Trump’s Nepo Pawn (Ellison) and the King of Failing Up (Zas) over the WBD bidding process - with Larry’s Kid (who’s ONLY even in this conversation bc of his last name and who enjoys the OBVIOUSLY illegal backing of a corrupt president) OPENLY WHINING about “fairness.”This from a brat who fired Colbert and bribed a sitting POTUS to get his first deal done and is now taking cash from dudes who literally murdered and chopped up an American journalist, to finance this New Deal.SEE: Zaslav choosing Netflix as the “winner” - despite overt, vocal, and rhetorically violent warnings from congress, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the California Department of Justice that they would vigorously oppose the combo of Netflix and WBD - because this deal will make Zas (and Malone) the most bank.WATCH: The tornado of bullshit that is about to ensue - for at least a year - as a deal for WBD does, does not, does, does not, then maybe does (but in the end might not) come to fruition... While thousands of filmmakers, artists and employees twist in the motherfucking wind.THE FACTS:🪩 The Paramount bid makes most sense for shareholders. It’s the only deal for the ENTIRE enterprise. Yet it breaks every anti-trust law ever made.🪩 The Netflix deal is best for consumers. It’ll allow us to get both HBO Max and Netflix, without having to pay for both. BUT... the deal also strands WBD’s STILL PROFITABLE linear TV assets in the Sea of Stupidity, alongside Versant Media. It IS also wholly unlikely to get approved.🪩 To clarify: To be clear, IF (a BIG if) this deals goes through: Netflix is paying a 34% premium for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s CURRENT price - FOR JUST HALF of the company. Before this process started, all of WBD was worth just $25 billion. In other words: Netflix is paying $72 billion for a $31 billion asset that was worth ONLY $12.5 billion just two months ago. Congratulations I guess?🪩 The Comcast offer for WBD is just a dumb idea from a company entirely out of ideas.🪩 NONE of these will happen for a LONG time. Whomsoever “wins” the bidding process will face congress, Attorneys General, the historically corrupt Chair of the Federal Communications Commission, EU legislators, and countless other regulatory and legal hurdles before they get anywhere near to closing any kind of deal.🪩 Meanwhile the lawyers and bankers print money.We just dropped a SPECIAL BREAKING NEWS edition of The Media Odyssey Podcast where and me break down all the breaking tea.WATCH OR LISTEN HERE.Grab some 🍿 and fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be an epic shit-show of Ego & Greed.Enjoy your weekend!ESHAP</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Canal+ has completed its long-trailed move into the Hungarian retail market with the launch of a dedicated Canal+ streaming service, replacing the Direct One consumer brand and deepening its partnership with 4iG. The Canal+ app went live in Hungary on 1 December 2025, offering a hybrid line-up that mixes live TV channels with on-demand films and series in a single environment tailored to the local market. Canal+ content had previously been sold in Hungary through the M7-owned Direct One platform, which itself evolved out of UPC Direct. The new service aggregates local and international linear channels and a catalogue of European and international movies and series, reflecting the Canal+ Group strategy of positioning its Central European platforms as curated, “European DNA” streaming offers with integrated live TV. Canal+ is drawing on StudioCanal and SPI International libraries to bolster the line-up. The launch coincides with the transfer of Direct One’s satellite TV base and B2B activities to Hungarian telecoms group 4iG. Following regulatory clearance, 4iG’s One Hungary unit has begun migrating Direct One satellite households onto its own TV packages, while Canal+ focuses on the OTT front end and branded pay-TV proposition. Canal+ and 4iG first outlined the Hungarian plan in July 2024, flagging that a standalone Canal+ app would arrive in 2025 and that Direct One’s role would shift to 4iG’s control. The 1 December switch marks the completion of that roadmap, giving Canal+ a unified D2C streaming foothold in another Central European market alongside Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Netherlands. Canal+ says it will continue to work with 4iG/One Hungary to distribute the new service on bundled terms, tapping the operator’s fixed and mobile footprint to grow penetration.</p>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <p class="content-text">Netflix has struck a definitive agreement to acquire Warner Bros, including its film and TV studios, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service, in a cash-and-stock deal that values the business at an enterprise value of around $82.7 billion (€71.0 billion).  The deal will close after WBD completes the previously announced separation of its Global Networks division into a new, publicly traded company, Discovery Global, now expected in Q3 2026.  Under the terms of the transaction, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shareholders will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 (€3.9) in Netflix stock for each WBD share, valuing the company at $27.75 (€23.8) per share and implying total equity value of approximately $72.0 billion (€61.8 billion). Netflix and WBD expect the acquisition to close 12–18 months after the spin-off, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. The acquisition hands Netflix control of one of Hollywood’s most familiar studios and its portfolio of premium brands and franchises. Warner Bros properties including The Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, the DC Universe, Harry Potter and Friends will ultimately sit alongside Netflix originals such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, Money Heist and Bridgerton under a single corporate roof. Netflix said it intends to maintain Warner Bros’ current operations, including theatrical releases, and use its global streaming footprint to extend the reach of the studio’s IP. HBO and HBO Max are positioned as a “complementary” premium offering inside Netflix’s future portfolio, rather than as a standalone rival service. While branding and packaging details have yet to be confirmed, Netflix is signalling a multi-tier approach that folds HBO’s series into broader streaming plans, with more scope to bundle libraries and windowing across its global service. The company is targeting $2–3 billion (€2.1–2.6 billion) in annual cost savings by year three and says the transaction should be accretive to earnings per share by the second year after closing. Discovery Global, the networks spin-off that sits outside the Netflix deal, will retain WBD’s linear and sports businesses including CNN, TNT Sports in the United States, Discovery-branded entertainment channels, European free-to-air outlets and streaming products such as Discovery+ and Bleacher Report. That structure effectively separates legacy cable and global channels from the studio and streaming assets Netflix is buying, and preserves an independent pay-TV and news portfolio for future consolidation moves. The agreement caps a months-long bidding war in which Paramount Skydance and Comcast also tabled offers. Paramount had been pursuing a full takeover of WBD, including CNN and the cable networks, while Netflix and Comcast focused on the studio and streaming operations. Reports over recent weeks suggested Netflix’s mostly cash proposal had moved into pole position, with WBD’s board ultimately backing the Netflix structure over rival bids. Paramount has already complained publicly about a “tilted” auction process and could still explore hostile options, though control of Warner Bros is now contractually committed to Netflix unless regulators intervene. The deal will now face intense scrutiny from competition authorities in the United States, Europe and other key markets, given the combination of Netflix’s global streaming scale with HBO’s premium subscription base and the Warner Bros studio. Lawmakers and industry groups have already flagged concerns about market concentration during the earlier bidding phase, and Netflix has prepared for a lengthy review process. </p>

                    <p class="content-text">Netflix has revealed that the AV1 open video codec now accounts for about 30% of all viewing on its platform, and is on course to become its most-used compression format “very soon”. The update comes in a new Netflix Tech Blog post reviewing the company’s AV1 rollout across devices and regions. AV1 was first deployed on Android mobile in 2020 using the dav1d software decoder, before expanding to smart TVs and other large screens in late 2021, web browsers in 2022, and Apple hardware starting with the A17 Pro and M3 chips in 2023. Netflix says 88% of large-screen devices submitted for certification between 2021 and 2025 support AV1, with almost all devices since 2023 capable of AV1 playback, typically up to 4K at 60fps. The streamer reports that AV1 now delivers higher perceived quality while reducing traffic on its Open Connect CDN and partner ISP networks. On average, AV1 streaming sessions achieve VMAF scores 4.3 points higher than AVC and 0.9 points higher than HEVC, while using one-third less bandwidth than both, leading to 45% fewer buffering interruptions. Netflix says the gains apply across its catalogue, from drama series to animation. Netflix is also using AV1 to underpin new premium features. AV1-based HDR streaming, launched in March 2025 using HDR10+ dynamic metadata, now covers about 85% of its HDR catalogue by viewing hours, with full coverage expected “within the next couple of months”. In July 2025 the company productised AV1 Film Grain Synthesis, stripping grain before encoding and reconstructing it on playback; Netflix claims this can cut bitrate by around two-thirds versus a conventional AV1 encode while delivering better-looking cinematic grain. So far, AV1 is mainly used for on-demand streaming, but Netflix says it is actively evaluating the codec for live events and cloud gaming, citing potential benefits for mass concurrent audiences and for layered graphics overlays in sports coverage. Looking ahead, the company points to AV2, the next-generation open codec that the Alliance for Open Media plans to finalise by the end of 2025, as the likely next step in its compression roadmap.</p>

He also runs A Colourful Storm – a fantastic indie label that massively punches above its weight when it comes to putting out charmingly moody experimental pop music, from artists as disparate as London-based percussionist Valentina Magaletti, dubby Hobart duo Troth, and renowned underground polymath Simon Fisher Turner. In 2017, the label released I Won’t Have to Think About You, a compilation of winsome, C86-ish indie pop. Earlier this year, it put out Going Back to Sleep, a quasi-sequel to that record which also functions as a neatly drawn guide to some of the best twee-pop groups currently working. Sydney band Daily Toll, whose 2025 debut A Profound Non-Event is one of the year’s underrated gems, contribute Time, a seven-minute melodica-and-guitar reverie. Chateau, the duo of Al Montfort (Terry, Total Control) and Alex Macfarlane (the Stevens, Twerps), push into percussive, psychedelic lounge pop on How Long on the Platform, while Who Cares?, one of Melbourne’s best new bands, channel equal parts Hope Sandoval and Eartheater on Wax and Wane. Elsewhere, Going Back to Sleep features tracks from San Francisco indie stalwarts the Reds, Pinks and Purples; minimalist Sydney group the Lewers; and sun-dappled folk-pop from Dutch duo the Hobknobs. It’s an unassuming compilation that’s almost certain to become well-loved and frequently referenced among connoisseurs of all things delicate and deeply felt. Shaad D’Souza Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">MultiChoice has warned DStv subscribers that a slate of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) channels could be removed from its platform from 1 January 2026 if the two companies fail to agree new distribution terms. In a note familiar to many pay-TV subscribers, Multichoice this week told its customers that its current carriage agreement with WBD expires on 31 December 2025 and that, with a month to go, no renewal has been finalised. The stand-off raises the prospect that up to 12 WBD services – spanning entertainment, lifestyle, kids and documentary genres – could disappear from DStv bouquets at the start of next year.T MultiChoice stressed that negotiations are continuing and framed the talks in terms of pricing and value, telling subscribers that “every time you subscribe, you trust us with your money”, and that it takes that responsibility seriously. The group has been under pressure to contain costs and maintain margins amid subscriber losses and a tougher economic environment across several African markets. At the same time, the operator moved to reassure viewers that DStv already carries a broad mix of local and international channels across all genres and said it is preparing to expand its line-up in 2026 with additional services and content offerings. Even if WBD networks do come off the platform, MultiChoice said subscribers would continue to have “strong alternative channels across every genre” and that it remains focused on delivering a “rich, diverse and enjoyable” viewing experience.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">An eco-masterpiece, icy intrigue, cyberpunkish cyborgs, memory-eating aliens and super-fast travel sends the world spinning out of controlCircular Motion Alex Foster (Grove) Alex Foster’s novel treats climate catastrophe through high-concept satire. A new technology of super-fast pods revolutionises travel: launched into low orbit from spring-loaded podiums, they fly west and land again in minutes, regardless of distance. Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, our globe starts to spin faster. Days contract, first by seconds, then minutes, and eventually hours. It’s a gonzo conceit, and Foster spells out the consequences, his richly rendered characters caught up in their own lives as the world spirals out of control. As days become six hours long, circadian rhythms go out of the window and oceans start to bulge at the equator. The increasing whirligig of the many strands of storytelling converge on their inevitable conclusion, with Foster’s sparky writing, clever plotting and biting wit spinning an excellent tale.When There Are Wolves Again EJ Swift (Arcadia) There are few more pressing issues with which fiction can engage than the climate crisis, and SF, with its capacity to extrapolate into possible futures and dramatise the realities, is particularly well placed to do so. Swift’s superb novel is an eco-masterpiece. Its near-future narrative of collapse and recovery takes us from the rewilding of Chornobyl and the return of wolves to Europe, through setback and challenge, to 2070, a story by turns tragic, alarming, uplifting, poetic and ultimately hopeful. Swift’s accomplished prose and vivid characterisation connect large questions of the planet’s destiny with human intimacy and experience, and she avoids either a too-easy doomsterism or a facile techno-optimism. We can bring the world back from the brink, but it will require honesty, commitment, hard work and a proper sense of stewardship. Continue reading...</p>

I’ve been making sandwiches professionally for 11 years and (of course) at home for much longer.

The simple, elegant exterior that reflects the surrounding scenery and evokes traditional Sami dwellings is matched by an interior that has the most comfortable pews I have ever sat on. The stunning glass mosaic titled the Return of Christ at one end may not be to everyone’s taste, but to me had power and majesty. Exiting this magnificent building after an organ recital to be met by the northern lights flickering overhead was awe-inspiring.Bruce Horton Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Authorities in Germany have carried out coordinated raids across three federal states as part of an investigation into a suspected organised pay-TV piracy network. The action targeted four men aged between 41 and 51 accused of large-scale card-sharing and the illegal provision of IPTV services. According to the public prosecutor’s office in Dessau-Roßlau and the State Criminal Police Office (LKA) of Saxony-Anhalt, searches were conducted on 2 December 2025 in Magdeburg and Lutherstadt Wittenberg, as well as in Delitzsch (Saxony) and Heldenstein (Bavaria). The investigation centres on allegations of commercial and gang-related computer fraud within the cybercrime domain. Investigators believe the suspects unlawfully shared pay-TV smartcards from a major provider over several years, distributing access to a large number of users via the internet. The resulting financial damage to rights holders is estimated to be at least in the mid-six-figure Euro range. During the raids, police seized extensive evidence, including computer systems, satellite receivers, IPTV boxes, servers, data storage devices and smartphones. Officers also performed live forensic captures of volatile data on external servers and were able to shut down illegal card sharing servers immediately. The investigation is ongoing, the authorities said.</p>

The company manages audience development and monetization on social and digital media, across more than 1,000 channels, for some of the biggest brands and IP on earth. Think Gordon Ramsey, Amazon Prime, Peacock. Chances are, you’ve become addicted to their work on one or more of your social feeds - across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, or even Facebook (yes, people still use Facebook). For each partner, for each brand, for each IP, Little Dot finds superfans to work on the projects, because they believe that’s the best way to find superfans to consume it. Theirs is not a one-size-fits all practice. Their work is tailor-made for each brand and hyper-crafted for each fandom.This week on The Media Odyssey, and I ask Ben Arnold and Holly Graham of Little Dot to walk us through how they turn IP into fandom and why fandom is stronger than “reach.” Moving forward, to survive and succeed, studios, producers, and brands all need to embrace the Affinity Economy and build a community, not just an audience. The good news is, you don’t have to do this on your own, or build this all in-house. These are the very things Little Dot does, as well as anyone on the planet.If these are the things you’re grappling with, this is a masterclass in all that. So, click around and find out!YOUTUBE | APPLE PODCASTS | SPOTIFYEnjoy the weekend!ESHAP</p>

                    <p class="content-text">“You never know what you’re gonna learn and taking risks almost always teaches you something about your own IP.” Holly Graham, Chief Commercial Officer, Little Dot StudiosWe’re not all running operations with 500 people and a global channel network (strong of 1000+ channels, 930M+ subscribers, 11B+ organic monthly views), so this week on The Media Odyssey Podcast, we’re bringing that expertise straight to you. and I spent an hour learning from Little Dot Studios’ Ben Arnold and Holly Graham to unpack what it actually takes to build digital fandom at scale. Their teams run everything from Gordon Ramsay’s universe to Prime Video UK’s YouTube channel, and they do it with a mix of scale, experimentation and super fans embedded inside every piece of IP.Little Dot pushes against a temptation most studios still fall for. There is no universal playbook and no shortcut that replaces testing, iteration and people who truly understand the IP. Their teams experiment with everything, from long-form runs and multi-episode cuts to fan edits, shorts, formats and titles. When the algorithm shifts, they see it early because they operate across more than a thousand channels. That scale gives them a window into behaviour the rest of the industry only half understands (hence why they launched ChIP last week). They also cut through a misconception we still hear every week. You don’t monetise channels, you monetise the flywheel. Gordon Ramsay is a good example. His channels didn’t just bring in ad revenue, they turned a long-running TV franchise into a digital ecosystem that keeps his brand culturally present, introduces him to new generations and feeds back into his broader traditional business.That’s only a fraction of what the team unpacked in this episode.

Sign up hereIt is hard to think of a more modern entertainment format than the open-world video game. These sprawling technological endeavours, which mix narrative, social connectivity and the complete freedom to explore, are uniquely immersive and potentially endless. But do they represent a whole new idea of storytelling?This week I met Dan Houser, the co-founder of Rockstar and lead writer on Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, who has been in London to talk about his new company, Absurd Ventures. He’s working on a range of intriguing projects, including the novel and podcast series A Better Paradise (about a vast online game that goes tragically wrong), and a comedy-adventure set in an online world named Absurdaverse.

They also want to make sure the amped-up, usually drunk crowd stays hydrated. Without water, a mosher might feel sick, faint or pass out. “You don’t want anyone to get injured or hurt,” frontman Pele Uriel said.Most of the spaces Uriel plays or visits have water stations where customers can easily fill up. But some do not. The worst offenders sell bottles of water at astronomical prices, from $5 to $10. “There have been times when I asked for water, but they charged a lot, so I went to the store next door to buy some,” Uriel said.

                    <p class="content-text">PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; Eyes Out/Blumhouse GamesPsychedelic visuals and a promising premise are let down by tired game design in this first-person horror with an appearance from the synthpop pioneerVideo games have delivered a feast of singular and wondrous sights in 2025: ecological fantasias teeming with magical beasts; stunning, historically obsessive recreations of feudal Japan. But here is an end-of-year curio: psychological horror game Sleep Awake serves us synth-rock pioneer Gary Numan stepping into what is perhaps the schlockiest role of his life – a gigantic floating head named Hypnos.This late-stage cameo is not quite indicative of the game as a whole; the handful of hours prior to Numan’s arrival are more mournful than madcap. Mostly, you explore the dilapidated, tumbledown streets of what is thought to be the last city on Earth. This setting is a magnificent work of imagination.

Our waiter carefully ladles the sugary, egg-yolk elixir, zabaglione, into two bowls for dunking warm pansarole doughnuts. Our conversation stops, a silent competition to nab the last one. We are literally living la dolce vita.This dessert is a tradition in Apricale, a fairytale-like village in Liguria, Italy’s crescent-shaped region that hugs the Mediterranean. It’s a far cry from crowded Cinque Terre and posh Portofino to the east. This western edge, on France’s south-eastern border, feels more authentic and calmer in the winter, with more local people than tourists. Unburdened from competing with others for reservations, you are free to live in the present. Let spontaneity be your guide – or, in my family’s case, our appetites. Continue reading...</p>

A lone bounty hunter in a familiar orange exosuit points her blaster ahead. Making my way towards the facility’s power generator, scanning doors and hunting for secret entrances, broken hatches and hidden keys, I suspect that I know exactly what’s going to happen when this place begins to thaw; every clank and creak sounds as if it could be a long-dormant beast busting out of one of those pods.

Samus, Nintendo’s coolest hero, is impeccably awesome, equipped here with new psychic powers that accent her suit with pulsing purple light. (I have taken many screenshots of her looking identically badass all over the game’s planet.) She is controlled with dual sticks, or – much better, much more intuitive – by pointing one of the Switch 2’s remotes at the screen to aim. Or even by using it as a mouse on a table or your knee, though this made my wrist hurt after a while.

                    <p class="content-text">It’s Premium subscribers who make this level of reporting, research and analysis possible. Become one of them today. Direct to consumer streaming was supposed to free streamers from gatekeepers. Build the app, own the relationship and shape the product on your terms. In practice, it has been anything but straightforward. Running a D2C service is expensive, slow and increasingly shaped by platforms you don’t control. Fragmentation has made distribution more complex, not less. The gatekeepers didn’t disappear, they changed. Cable and telco bundles gave way to device makers, TV OS home screens and retail marketplaces. Among those marketplaces, Amazon Channels stands out for one simple reason. Amazon sits at the intersection of retail trust, Prime household scale and frictionless checkout. No other marketplace combines these exact three advantages at this scale.For years, Channels was dominated by niche and specialty streamers. In 2025, the shift is unmistakable. Big names from Apple TV+, DAZN to European broadcasters are joining with their ad free tiers. ITVX Premium now sits inside Prime Video in the UK at £5.99 per month while RTL+ Premium is live as a Prime add on in Germany and Austria at €12.99.This is not a simple distribution add on. This is broadcasters putting their premium product inside someone else’s product and when you do that, beware of the changes.Today at a glance: Amazon Channels is not just distribution, it is product substitutionWhat ITVX Premium and RTL+ turn into inside Prime VideoWhy broadcasters say yes to Channels in 2025The risks they cannot ignoreThe bigger question in 2026 & beyondSubscribe nowAmazon Channels is not just distribution, it is product substitutionMost people still misunderstand what Channels is. They treat it just as any reseller but Channels is a content first environment, not an app first one. Users search, click or browse inside Prime Video. They rarely start by thinking “let me open ITVX” or “I feel like RTL+ today.” They see a programme tile, tap it, Amazon places a paywall, they subscribe in one click and stay in Prime Video.Amazon handles identity, billing, cancellations, notifications, recommendations, device authentication, profiles, watchlists, downloads. Everything that defines the actual product experience.This is how specialty streamers have lived inside Channels for years. They are branded corners, catalogues wrapped in Amazon’s UX. By joining Channels, ITVX Premium and RTL+ accept the same terms. Their product no longer lives as they designed it, it lives as Amazon needs it to. When you integrate Channels, you stop being a destination, you become a tile.What ITVX Premium and RTL+ turn into inside Prime VideoLet’s look at the actual user journey. Read more</p>

Advertisers seek transparency, publishers rely on predictable revenue, and platforms want efficiency. None of these goals can be reached solely through ad insertion.

Folks on the waitlist will have first priority 👇🏻Join the waitlistTubi UK has entered its second year in one of the toughest free streaming markets in the world. The platform has momentum: viewership up 250% (since launch), a catalog that doubled in twelve months (from 20 to 40K assets), a roaster of 19 distribution partners (with Titan as the latest addition) and a rare demographic skew with 65% of its audience under 44.

Tubi’s position is clear. It is not trying to replicate BBC iPlayer or ITVX. It is building a free alternative that leans on depth, fandoms and a viewing experience centered on choice.

Movies carry most of the load: Tubi UK’s film library exceeds 10,000 titles and grabs 70% of viewership. “We’re not the arbiters of taste. Whatever you’re into, we’ll have plenty of it.” Ross Appleton (Streaming Made Easy interview)This AVOD foundation begs the question: What role does FAST play in a product where almost all viewing is on-demand?FAST exists for three reasons: Read more</p>
