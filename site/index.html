Meeting at noon by the Physical Energy statue in the centre of the park, the dogs – well, the owners really – competed in a best-dressed competition before enjoying an hour of play and socialising before the parade. Ana said previous years’ events had ended up attracting as many as a thousand people and dogs. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The president announces non-existent emergencies to invoke extraordinary powers – and neutralizes the oppositionThis month, we learned that, in the course of bombing a boat of suspected drug smugglers, the US military intentionally killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage after its initial air assault. In addition, Donald Trump said it was seditious for Democratic members of Congress to inform members of the military that they can, and indeed, must, resist patently illegal orders, and the FBI and Pentagon are reportedly investigating the members’ speech. Those related developments – the murder of civilians and an attack on free speech – exemplify two of Trump’s principal tactics in his second term. The first involves the assertion of extraordinary emergency powers in the absence of any actual emergency. The second seeks to suppress dissent by punishing those who dare to raise their voices. Both moves have been replicated time and time again since January 2025. How courts and the public respond will determine the future of constitutional democracy in the United States.Nothing is more essential to a liberal democracy than the rule of law – that is, the notion that a democratic government is guided by laws, not discretionary whims; that the laws respect basic liberties for all; and that independent courts have the authority to hold political officials accountable when they violate those laws. These principles, forged in the United Kingdom, adopted and revised by the United States, are the bedrock of constitutional democracy. But they depend on courts being willing and able to check government abuse, and citizens exercising their rights to speak out in defense of the fundamental values when those values are under attack.David Cole is the Honorable George J Mitchell professor in law and public policy at Georgetown University and former national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. This essay is adapted from his international rule of law lecture sponsored by the Bar Council. Continue reading...</p>

I kept telling myself to hold on another few kilometres until the bus got to my stop, and then I could make a mad dash for the nearest public toilet to throw up. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">For years it’s been predicted that the market for male ‘support garments’ will take off … but it hasn’t quite happened. Now M&S is trying againThere is a moment – just seconds into getting dressed – when I think I might panic. The hem of my stretchy top has got rolled up round my ribs before my head has popped out of the neck hole, and with my hands still stuck in the sleeves, I cannot reach round to pull it down. I wriggle helplessly for a minute, but the situation doesn’t improve; the band of rolled-up fabric is taut across my chest, immovable. That’s when I feel the first tingle of rising alarm – so familiar from early childhood – that comes of being trapped in your clothes.I am trying, for the first time, to put on an item of shapewear for men – an ordinary-looking, highly elasticated long-sleeved workout top that will, I hope, give me the instant slim profile of someone who goes to the gym regularly, instead of not since the pandemic started.

The daughter of actor Vanessa Redgrave and director and producer Tony Richardson, she trained at Rada, and rose to prominence with roles in 101 Dalmatians, Nip/Tuck and The Tudors, as well as in theatre and on Broadway. More recently, she appeared in Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen, and Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale. Richardson is working for Save the Children’s annual festive fundraiser, Christmas Jumper Day, and also backing the charity’s new Christmas campaign.I remember this as a happy day, but my eyes tell a different story. They look a little mistrustful. In my arms is my brother Carlo – we have different fathers; his is Italian actor Franco Nero. That day was Carlo’s christening, and it was obvious from my hand position that I’m not used to standing like that. Someone’s gone: “Put your arms out! We’re taking a picture of you holding the baby!” The whole thing looks awkward. Continue reading...</p>

Why hasn’t it advanced along with other forms of progress? Or has it?Over the course of human evolution, our brains, our knowledge, technology, healthcare and longevity have advanced hugely. Why has human nature not evolved at the same rate? It seems to me that every country has criminals and every age in history had warfare. We seem to be as morally primitive as our distant ancestors.

Providing my user name would be OK – the authorities would get sick of scrolling through chicken pics before they found anything critical of their Glorious Leader – but what if I have to hand over my phone at the border, as has happened to some travellers already? I would rather get deported.There’s nothing criminal or egregiously immoral on there; I don’t foment revolution or indulge in Trump trolling, tempting as that would be. But my phone does not paint a flattering picture of me. Does anyone’s? Those shiny black rectangles have become contemporary confessionals, and we would like to believe they abide by the same kind of confidentiality rules. Continue reading...</p>

He likes Palace, who he thinks are a good, all-round side, while Oliver Glasner is happy to have Ismailia Sarr back, especially because of his pace in behind. He replaces Eddie Nketiah, but the fantastic Daniel Munoz is still unavailable, so Nathaniel Clyne continues at right-back.Looking more closely at the teams, Sunderland make three changes, one in defence, one in midfield and one in attack: Reinildo, whose name has ISS overtones, replaces Trai Hume; Chemsdine Talbi is in for Lutsharel Geertruida; and Brian Brobbey plays up front, not Wilson Isidor.

                    <p class="content-text">Whether it’s nightclubs banning phones or a drop in online dating, there are signs that we’re rediscovering the joy of being in the momentIt’s only a small rectangular sticker, but it symbolises a joyous sense of resistance. Some of Berlin’s most renowned clubs have long insisted that the camera lenses on their clientele’s phones must be covered up using this simple method, to ensure that everyone is present in the moment and people can let go without fear of their image suddenly appearing on some online platform. As one DJ puts it, “Do you really want to be in someone’s picture in your jockstrap?”Venues in London, Manchester and New York now enforce the same rules. Last week brought news of the return of Sankeys, the famous Mancunian club that closed nearly a decade ago, and is reopening in a 500-capacity space in the heart of the city. The aim, it seems, is to fly in the face of the massed closures of such venues, and revive the idea that our metropolises should host the kind of nights that stretch into the following morning. But there is another basic principle at work: phones will reportedly either be stickered or forbidden. “People need to stop taking pictures and start dancing to the beat,” said one of the club’s original founders.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

                    <p class="content-text">From athletes such as Tristan Thompson to artists such as Iggy Azalea, celebrities have returned to hawking cryptoFollowing the numbers suggests Tristan Thompson is nearing the end of his basketball career. While the 6ft 9in center once regularly played more than 80 games in a regular season, he’s hit new career lows, appearing just 40 times on court during the 2024-2025 season. Following the money, however, suggests Thompson is pivoting into a new career. He’s rebranded as a crypto investor, consultant and brand ambassador, bringing his relative cultural cache to the blockchain. Now the host of his own podcast, Courtside Crypto, he has made frequent appearances with other crypto celebrities, such as at the Nasdaq in September, when he celebrated the IPO of an explicitly nationalist Bitcoin mining operation alongside Eric Trump; Thompson has also developed a crypto startup slated to launch in 2026.In 2025, crypto is back in style in Washington and among a growing set in Hollywood, where Thompson lives adjacent to the Kardashian clan, some of whom have been crypto spokespeople. Donald Trump has reversed Joe Biden’s legal offensive against crypto, debuting his own token, $Trump, before his inauguration, and rolling back government actions against the industry, which heavily supported him during his bid for the presidency. Celebrities have likewise returned to hawking cryptocurrency projects or launching tokens of their own. Continue reading...</p>

Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash more than 2,000 jobs as part of corporate restructuring.Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions. Sherman accepted the news and the two men wished each other good luck. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The Russian public prosecutor’s office has classified the German international service Deutsche Welle (DW) as an “undesirable organisation,” according to Russian media reports referred to by the broadcaster. The Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, has welcomed the decision, reports DW, adding that this decision followed a request from the State Duma on 20 August 2024. “Russia may label us an undesirable organisation, but that won’t deter us. This latest attempt to silence free media highlights the Russian regime’s blatant disregard for press freedom and exposes its fear of independent information. Despite censorship and blocking of our services by the Russian government, DW’s Russian-language service now reaches more people than ever before. We will continue to report independently – on the war of aggression against Ukraine and other topics about which little information is available in Russia. So that people can form their own opinions,” said DW Director General Barbara Massing. In Russia, cooperating with “undesirable organisations” is a criminal offense, subject to heavy fines and, in severe cases, imprisonment. Even sharing content from such organisations – such as posting their journalistic work on social media – is considered a crime. For Russian citizens, the ban on cooperation also applies outside Russian territory. This means that Russian employees of DW are particularly affected. Since March 2022, DW has been labeled a “foreign agent” in Russia, a designation used by Russia for individuals, media and organisations funded from abroad. Prior to this, DW faced a broadcasting ban, its Moscow studio was forced to relocate, and its website was blocked across all languages in Russia. Being labeled an “undesirable organisation” is an escalation of the crackdown on DW. The decision is made by the Russian Prosecutor General or his representatives. The organisation concerned is then entered into the relevant register. DW has not yet received any official notification from the Russian authorities. In addition to DW, numerous media organisations, NGOs, and foundations are considered “undesirable organisations,” including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Bellingcat, Correctiv, Reporters Without Borders and TV Rain. To help users in Russia continue accessing independent information, DW is increasingly relying on digital platforms and offering tools to bypass censorship, such as the Tor browser, VPN access, and the DW app. In addition, the new DW Access app offers users another secure way to circumvent censorship and stay informed. Users can download it via the dedicated DW platform www.access-unlocked.org or share it directly via messenger services or Bluetooth. DW Russian reaches around 10 million weekly users in 2025, mostly through video content. This makes DW Russian one of DW’s top 10 most-used services. DW also produces a daily 30-minute Russian-language video news program, DW Novosti, and the satirical show Zapovednik, produced in Riga, remains popular. Since March 2024, DW’s Russian-language programming has also been included in the TV-Swoboda (“Freedom”) package by Reporters Without Borders. This package features around 20 independent Russian-language TV and radio channels, broadcast via Eutelsat Hotbird satellites.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Last time the fierce enmity between Mozart and Salieri was adapted for the screen, it won a best picture Oscar. Now a new TV version turns up the temperature several notches – but will its stars develop a rivalry of their own?“A prodigal son story with God as the father,” is how actor Paul Bettany describes Amadeus, the Peter Shaffer play that became a celebrated film in 1984. Both depict the rivalry between Austrian court composer Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a former child phenomenon whose towering talent exposes Salieri as mediocre and stuck in his ways. Salieri, who believes a composer’s gift to be divine, is so affronted by this upstart that he renounces God and sets about destroying Mozart.Now Amadeus has been remade for TV, with Will Sharpe in the title role and Bettany as Salieri. The series, which begins with Mozart arriving in Vienna in a rickety carriage and promptly throwing up in the street, is written by Joe Barton, the Black Doves and Giri/Haji writer known for his leftfield approach to genre TV. Little surprise, then, that Amadeus takes liberties with the classic period drama, injecting it with modern-day dialogue and gloriously anarchic flourishes.

Become one of them today ❤️🇬🇧 Streaming Made Easy is off to London!You ask, I deliver 😊 After a first meet up in Amsterdam in November, London is next.On January 21st 2026, I’m hosting an event in partnership with Little Dot Studios for a session on The State of Advertising - 2026. A breakfast followed by a fireside chat with best in class advertising execs (line up to be announced soon). I’m always trying to learn something new but with advertising I still feel like it’s day 1. 10 years ago, M&E executives could do without it. Today, our businesses have gone full hybrid and so it’s imperative we understand what the ad market has in store for us next year. Fancy joining us?👉🏻 Register here: https://luma.com/n3jlxtdp📍Little Dot Studios (91 Brick Ln, London)📦 YouTube TV redraws the bundleYouTube TV is preparing a shift that looks less like product iteration and more like a structural correction: genre-based plans. Lower entry points with sports, news, entertainment split out instead of bundled together by default. Customers may end up recreating a multi-genre bundle at a higher price point but it will be by choice this time. What matters is not the packaging itself but the timing. Price pressure is mounting, churn is baked in and the “one giant bundle” logic is starting to crack, even at YouTube TV which has been the new kid on the vMVPD block, strong of its 8M subs, the last official number quoted by Google. Will unbundling intelligently help Pay TV survive or thrive? 2026 will be telling. Find out more in the company's latest blog.🎧 Prompt that playlistSpotify is opening a small but meaningful crack in the recommendation machine. A new feature now in testing lets users (in New Zealand aka Scotland but further - if you have that TV series reference, we’re meant to meet) actively “power” playlists with natural language prompts, nudging the algorithm instead of passively accepting it.This is not about better playlists. It’s about a shift in control. For the first time, personalization becomes collaborative rather than invisible. Taste, mood, context and even what’s trending online start to mix explicitly with listening history. The algorithm stops being a black box and becomes something you negotiate with.What makes this moment interesting is the timing. Platforms everywhere are rethinking how much agency users should have. If this sticks, it signals a broader transition from “the algorithm knows best” to “the algorithm listens back” and that has implications far beyond music.🎙️ Grading 2025This week on The Media Odyssey Podcast, and I did something most people avoid: we graded our own 2025 predictions. Not to chase scores but to surface patterns. Some calls landed cleanly, others aged badly (mostly mine because Evan only chose the ones he was right about 😁) and a few turned into something more interesting than “right” or “wrong.”The most honest moment comes at the end. 2025 was brutal for jobs across media. We talk openly about what helps when the market contracts, what doesn’t and how to stay grounded when certainty disappears. If you want to know who graded what, and why, you’ll have to listen. Full episode is live wherever you get your podcasts: APPLE PODCASTS | SPOTIFY | YOUTUBE.For my entire prediction report card 👇🏻🇵🇹 MFE’s hunger for scaleMFE (Media for Europe) took a 32.9% stake in Impresa, the broadcaster behind SIC and publisher of Expresso. They’re not taking control but they’re taking position. Advertising sales, digital platform upgrades and local production are the first areas of cooperation.It’s another sign of MFE stitching together a pan-European footprint that actually means something commercially: Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria (with the recent takeover of ProSieben SAT1 in September) and now Portugal form a contiguous ad market where major brands already buy across borders.The interesting part: partnerships like this (and mergers) are what Europe will increasingly look like in 2026 and beyond. No one gets scale alone. Read the full press release. 🎰 The must have app for CESI’m heading to CES for the 1st time and I have no clue where to start (Who’s coming? Where to meet?). Jason Cohen, CEO of MyBundle, built this for us so we can find each other amongst the slot machines 😁🤖 The rise of the AI subscriber New research from Bango on AI subscribers shows something unprecedented in the subscription economy. Among people paying for AI tools, 67% say AI is their single most important subscription. Three-quarters call it “essential” to daily life. And yes: 61% would rather cancel all streaming services than give up their AI suite.This isn’t a small niche. It’s a new gravitational center. AI subscribers pay on average 66 dollars per month, plan to add more tools and increasingly demand bundling with mobile, broadband, banking and even streaming services.The strategic question is no longer whether AI will be bundled. It’s who owns the billing relationship when AI becomes the super-app for digital life. If ChatGPT becomes the front door for subscriptions, the OS wars in CTV will look tame by comparison.Read more in Bango’s “Rise of the AI Subscriber” study. 🗳️ Poll time That’s it for today.

                    <p class="content-text">After the tumult of four managers in two years, back-to-back wins have eased some of the unrest at League One clubThe last time Plymouth hosted Rotherham was the penultimate Saturday before Christmas 2023, when a dramatic 3-2 Championship win was the last before Steven Schumacher left – in a helicopter, so it is said – for Stoke. Then everything started to go wrong, hence the relief on Saturday when Plymouth beat Rotherham 1-0, relieving pressure on Tom Cleverley and fears of a second successive relegation.It wasn’t pretty but while a smart first-half finish from Joe Ralls was not quite enough to lift the Devon side out of the League One dropzone, it did send the 14,000 or so Plymouth fans home happy for the first time in months. Cleverley, appointed in the summer, was certainly smiling after a second 1-0 win in four days even if his men spent much of the second half hanging on. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">I defy anyone to watch the Nigella Christmas special and feel anything but drunk on yuletide bonhomieIf your run-up to Christmas already feels a bit chaotic, there’s always a cosy nook of the TV schedule where nothing but gorgeous, kitsch, heartwarming things happen. And by that I mean the cooking channels, where it’s currently full-on re-run time. Nigel Slater’s 12 Tastes of Christmas, anyone? That episode of Fanny Cradock at Christmas when she folds mincemeat into an omelette? I defy anyone to watch my own personal favourite, 2017’s Nigella: At My Table, Christmas special and feel anything but drunk on yuletide bonhomie. Or just drunk, considering our Nigella’s first recipe is a massive Christmas vodka martini featuring vodka, raspberry liqueur and enough crème de cacao blanc to stun a reindeer. Later, she whips up a no-churn brandy and salted caramel ice-cream and souses some red cabbage with cranberries. Heaven.I won’t make a single one of these recipes, though; I’m just here to gawp. Behold, my Christmas angel, utterly resplendent in chic, countryside garb and ambling about her fairylight-strewn cottage (even though it’s actually a TV set in Elstree with a BBC snow machine turned up to 11). Ooh, devilled eggs and duck à l’orange? I should make those! (Spoiler: I won’t.) But whether or not we make these Yuletide recipes, all these festive specials by Nigella, Jamie, Nigel, Keith and Fanny provide a sterling service to the stressed home cook. In the Capital Floyd: Christmas Specials from 2000, Keith isn’t remotely stressed by a 12-pound turkey with giblets or a gravlax starter for nine. Yes, perhaps that’s because he’s been glugging Chateau Lafite Rothschild since 9am, but no one can accuse our man Floyd of an iota of festive fluster. Tom Kerridge Cooks Christmas, meanwhile, is another delight in which he rolls his turkey into kievs with sage butter, mulls cider and whips up some Christmas pud ice-cream. Tom doesn’t so much as break a sweat, and it’s all clearly completely doable with a bit of pre-thought, a good spud peeler and some elbow power! It’s all in the planning, he says. Obviously, the tinsel-covered elephant in all of these rooms – and the one that’s never, ever mentioned – is that all these Christmas specials were very pre-planned. So much so, in fact, that they were recorded all the way back in April, with a cast of at least 25 researchers, producers, home economists, food stylists and lighting technicians all working for weeks to ensure that Nigella’s cottage is so spectacularly seasonal that we go all misty-eyed while watching the woman whip meringue into snowy peaks.Grace Dent is judge and co-presenter of finals week for BBC One’s Celebrity MasterChef on Tuesday 15 December and Friday 19 December Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Forget homeschooling, how about taking your family on a perpetual gap year and quitting the nine-to-five? Families who did just that share the hostel horrors and mid-trip meltdowns behind the Instagram feedIt was going to be the adventure of a lifetime. Late last year, Josy and Joe Davis decided to quit their jobs, sell their home and pull their two young daughters out of school to travel the world. Though their life in Gloucestershire was good on paper, post-pandemic it had been increasingly feeling like a grind. Josy, 35, a police dispatcher, worked shifts that swung from early morning to late night. Joe, also 35, a logistics manager, was often on call until 10pm. Neither felt as if they could ever switch off – let alone enjoy family time.Exhausted, Josy caught herself being short with her daughters, Lola and Zara, six and four. “I felt like I spent my days off recovering, rather than actually being present,” she says.

She would, she explained, reveal how an “international network of leftists work to subvert democracy and the will of the people”.Despite her bleak monologue, Truss pointed to hope from across the Atlantic. “We’re going to look at the Trump revolution and see how this can be achieved in Britain,” she said. “We’ll be talking to the leading lights of the Maga movement.” Continue reading...</p>

Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, a leader of the notorious, government-backed Janjaweed militia that committed genocide in Sudan’s Darfur region from 2003 to 2005, was jailed for 20 years last week by the international criminal court (ICC). He had been found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.Although hundreds of militia were involved, Abd-al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, is the first person to be convicted of atrocities in Darfur, now again the scene of terrible violence in Sudan’s civil war. The ICC has charged Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s president at the time, with genocide and war crimes. Ahmad Harun, a former minister, faces similar charges. But both men have evaded arrest.

By then, the business was well established and my dad stayed on as CEO. My dad gave my brother 80% of it. He will now sell the business and realise millions, meaning he can retire early.My dad helped me with university fees and house purchases. He’s told me I will inherit the house and whatever money is left when my parents pass away, which is likely to be in about 20 years. I doubt there will be anything left. Continue reading...</p>

But for Brendon McCullum, the latter is irrelevant. The England head coach has instead backed an unchanged top seven to deliver a fightback in the third Ashes Test and flip a narrative that has already featured talk of a whitewash bubble up.At 2-0 down with three to play, all wriggle room has disappeared for England. But talk of Ollie Pope potentially being dropped, or even Ben Stokes moving to No 3, was shot down by McCullum as his players resumed training on Sunday afternoon. No going back now was the message.

But the world is still too often designed without wheelchair users in mindA lot has changed for people with disabilities since the 1950s, when the then seven-year-old Alice Moira was given her first wheelchair – not least the fact that it was made of wood and she couldn’t push it herself. Technology has come on in leaps and bounds, of course, as has society’s understanding of disability, while moves towards flexible working have, in some ways, made things easier. But wheelchair users still face challenges in a world that, so often, has been designed without them in mind. Recent plans to make cuts to disability benefits in the UK have raised concerns that disability rights might be retreating. Thirty years on from the UK’s Disability Discrimination Act becoming law, Moira, now 81, chats to 25-year-old Lochlann O’Higgins about what their experiences of using a wheelchair have had in common – and how they differ.Do you remember the first time you used a wheelchair? Lochlann O’Higgins: No, I was two. My parents told me about it, though. I have brittle bone disease, so I used to break my bones a lot and I couldn’t walk. In the hospital, the first time I got in a wheelchair, I apparently just jumped in it and started wheeling up and down the corridor, having the best time of my life because I was able to move around freely for the first time. The nurses and my mum were scared I was going to crash into a wall. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Festive theatrical feasts serve audiences a slap-up dinner with their entertainment. But is what’s on stage as appetising as what’s on your plate?In west London, a line of smartly dressed theatregoers on a street corner enter a building and walk back in time. We pass through tight lamp-lit corridors and arrive in a cavernous hall, with tables laid and lanterns dangling overhead. This is Charles Dickens’ parlour, where he has just finished writing A Christmas Carol, and it’s dinner time.The Great Christmas Feast is an immersive production in which a three-course meal is served while a quicksilver Dickens (David Alwyn) narrates his ghost story about the perils of penny-pinching in the season of goodwill. Immersive theatre has evidently concocted a tasty festive offshoot that might suit those tired of watching yet another straight-up adaptation of the classic tale. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">White House official confirms Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff will meet with Zelenskyy and European leaders this weekend. What we know on day 1,390Donald Trump’s special envoy will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders in Berlin this weekend, the White House said, as Washington presses for a plan to end the war. Germany said earlier on Saturday that it would host US and Ukrainian delegations over the weekend for talks on a ceasefire, before a summit involving European leaders and Zelenskyy in Berlin on Monday. Zelenskyy also confirmed that he will personally meet with Donald Trump’s Steve Witkoff in the series of meetings: “Most importantly, I will be meeting with envoys of President Trump, and there will also be meetings with our European partners, with many leaders, concerning the foundation of peace – a political agreement to end the war,” Zelenskyy said in an address to the nation late on Saturday.Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov reaffirmed Friday that Moscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from parts of the Donetsk region that they still control. Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard troops would stay in parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas even if they become a demilitarised zone under a prospective peace plan – a demand likely to be rejected by Ukraine.Russia attacked five Ukrainian regions overnight, targeting the country’s energy and port infrastructure, according to Zelenskyy, who said the attacks involved more than 450 drones and 30 missiles. With temperatures hovering around freezing, Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said more than a million people were without electricity.An attack on Odesa caused grain silos to catch fire at the coastal city’s port, Ukrainian deputy prime minister and reconstruction minister Oleksiy Kuleba said. Two people were wounded in attacks on the wider region, according to regional head Oleh Kiper.Germany has said it will send a group of soldiers to Poland to help with a project to fortify the country’s eastern border as worries mount about the threat from Russia. Poland, a strong supporter of Ukraine in its fight against Moscow, announced plans in May last year to bolster a long stretch of its border that includes Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The main task of the German soldiers in Poland will be “engineering activities,” a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said late Friday.About 480 people were evacuated Saturday from a train traveling between the Polish city of Przemysl and Kyiv after police received a call concerning a threat on the train, Karolina Kowalik, a spokesperson for the Przemysl police, said. Nobody was hurt and she didn’t elaborate on the threat. Polish authorities are on high alert since multiple attempts to disrupt trains on the line linking Warsaw to the Ukrainian border, including the use of explosives in November, with Polish authorities saying they have evidence Russia was behind it.Ukraine’s navy accused Russia of deliberately attacking a civilian Turkish vessel carrying sunflower oil to Egypt with a drone on Saturday, a day after Moscow hit two Ukrainian ports: “Russia delivered a targeted strike using a drone against the Turkish vessel ‘VIVA’, which was en route to Egypt carrying sunflower oil,” Ukraine’s navy said on social media. None of the 11 crew were wounded and the ship was able to continue its journey, it added.Ukraine received 114 prisoners released by Belarus on Saturday, Kyiv’s PoW coordination centre said. The centre’s statement said that the released captives would receive medical attention, and those Belarusian citizens who so wished would subsequently be transported to Poland or Lithuania.

That tournament can be seen in hindsight as a watershed for the English game, the first indication that the elite player performance plan (EPPP) and the England DNA project – taking youth football seriously – might be beginning to pay off.Youth football is notoriously unpredictable and England’s record in the Under-17 World Cup since shows a failure to qualify and a pair of last-16 exits, but following that 2017 success, England’s senior side have reached two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final, while the under-21s have won two European titles. Two previous Golden Ball winners from Under-17 World Cups – Cesc Fàbregas and Toni Kroos – have gone on to win the senior World Cup. Some, such as Landon Donovan, Anderson and Kelechi Iheanacho have had perfectly decent careers. And others have vanished almost entirely: Sani Emmanuel of Nigeria, for instance, won in 2009 then made just 16 senior appearances, 10 of them in the Swiss second tier with Biel-Bienne; while another Nigerian, Kelechi Nwakali, winner in 2015, joined Arsenal but, after a series of loan moves and stints in the lower reaches of the Spanish and Portuguese systems, was kicked out of Barnsley this past summer after returning late for pre-season.

                    <p class="content-text">The wife of the Trump adviser aims to entice conservative women into Maga – but like much of the rest of the movement, her sales pitch is fundamentally lackingWhen Katie Miller, the wife of Donald Trump’s powerful adviser Stephen Miller, interviewed Pete Hegseth on her podcast last week, she didn’t ask him about whether the war secretary had ordered the US military to kill the shipwrecked survivors of an airstrike. She didn’t ask him about the settlement he paid a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her. Nor did she ask about allegations of alcohol abuse, or the accusation that he had made his ex-wife so terrified that she hid in a closet.Instead, when Hegseth and his wife, Jennifer Rauchet, appeared on the Katie Miller Podcast, the titular host asked questions like: “If you could write one Hegseth family rule on that whiteboard, what is that?” Continue reading...</p>

Truffles may come in endless variations, but at their core, they are simply chocolate and cream, which makes the quality of both non-negotiable.A good dark chocolate, about 60-70% cocoa, brings complexity and depth without bitterness, while the right cream-to-chocolate ratio creates a ganache that’s smooth, rich and just soft enough to dissolve in the mouth. Any further additions such as salt, liqueur, citrus, coffee or spices should never be dominant. And, whatever the finish, be it cocoa powder, toasted nuts, coconut or a glossy shell, it should complement rather than compete with the chocolate ganache inside. Continue reading...</p>

Especially one whose coup de maître is a goes-with-everything white sneaker. Yet 20 years after Veja first began selling sustainable footwear, it has become the ultimate affordable It brand for scooter-wielding mums, sustainably minded millennials and A-list bigwigs who want to wear their values on their ethical leather-clad feet.Veja’s co-founder Sébastien Kopp says he doesn’t know if people buy his trainers because of how they are made or because of how they look. The company is fastidious about social and fairtrade practices, “but because we don’t do surveys, we don’t do marketing, we simply don’t know this information”, he says, speaking from Veja’s Paris headquarters.

                    <p class="content-text">By using music from SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo in ICE videos, the government is playing a game of rage-baitLast week, as the Trump administration was engulfed in controversy over its illegal military strikes near Venezuela (among numerous other crises), a Department of Homeland Security employee – I picture the worst sniveling, self-satisfied, hateful loser – got to work on the official X account. The state-employed memelord posted a video depicting Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, celebrating the humiliation and incarceration of undocumented immigrants as some sort of patriotic achievement. The vile video borrowed, as they often do, from mainstream pop culture; in this case, a viral lyric from Sabrina Carpenter’s song Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?,” referring to sex positions – overlaid clips of agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing people, cheekily nodding to all the methods in ICE’s terror toolbox.Carpenter, as a pre-eminent pop star, was caught in an impossible position. Say nothing, as her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift did weeks earlier when the White House used her music in a Trump hype video, and risk appearing as if you condone the administration’s use of your art for a domestic terror campaign (the administration hasn’t yet used Swift for an ICE video, but I’m sure it’s coming); engage, even if to honestly express your utter disgust, and risk bringing more attention to objectionable propaganda designed to provoke a response.

                    <p class="content-text">The ban on under-16s accessing ‘harmful’ content that began this week has overwhelming approval from adults – even if it had a few teething issuesA few weeks ago, my 14-year-old went into the garage, pulled out his skateboard and told me this was going to be his “skate park summer”. I was curious about what was sparking his renewed interest in an activity he hadn’t thought about since he was 12. His response: “The ban.”I was thrilled. As far as I was concerned, Australia’s world-first social media law aimed at preventing children under 16 from accessing social media apps was already a success. But this week, as the ban took effect, my son wasn’t so sure. Access to his accounts remained largely unchanged. Many of his friends were in the same position. Across the country, the rollout has been uneven, as social media companies try to work out how to verify kids’ ages.Sisonke Msimang is the author of Always Another Country: A Memoir of Exile and Home (2017) and The Resurrection of Winnie Mandela (2018) Continue reading...</p>

It has been a horrible first half of the WSL season for Liverpool and, while the gaze of the world’s football media has been drawn towards the future of “the Egyptian King”, Mo Salah, on Merseyside, the women’s team look increasingly in danger of slipping down the pyramid.It is by no means a hopeless situation for Gareth Taylor, whose bottom-of-the-table side face second-bottom West Ham on Sunday. But after Thursday’s 3-0 defeat at Aston Villa, it was clear on social media that portions of the fanbase are losing patience, with some supporters calling for the manager to go after only 10 league games.

It feels like a family reunion – but one where everyone is hugely charmingPeep Show is not really a TV show. It’s closer to an identity now, embedded in the collective British DNA. A decade after the show finished, many of us still call each other “Clean Shirt”, notice logos in foam or quip about crack being “very moreish”. The only show more emblematic of the UK’s national psyche is The Great British Bake Off. Therefore rejoice, for the hottest collab of the holiday is here! I’m calling this the real reason for the season. The true raisin for the praisin’, perhaps.They’re so much part of our lives, it’s hard to see these bakers as actors. It feels more natural to say that this Christmas the Bake Off tent will host a reunion of Mark, Sophie, Big Suze, Super Hans and Dobby. Together again, like family, your family. It’s glorious to see them – older, some bearded, not one of them less charming. No proceeds from this are going to charity because there aren’t any. This is happening purely for joy.

I had night blindness and blind spots in my field of view. At 44, I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic eye condition that causes the retina cells to die. I had always been a very visually oriented person: I was a practising architect, and someone who loved to read, draw, go to the cinema and visit art exhibitions. So when black text disappeared on a glaring white page, films became impossible to follow and artworks only took shape once explained to me, I questioned who I would be without my vision.Around the age of 50, I had a particularly stressful year: I got divorced; dissolved my business; started a new job; moved house; and my dad died. As my life fell off a cliff, so did my eyesight, so that by 2015 my field of vision had decreased to only 5-10 degrees (a healthy average person’s is about 200 degrees). I was registered blind, but for a long time I lived in denial, not telling anyone how much vision I had lost. At work, feeling vulnerable and like I could lose my job, I presented as fully sighted, a daily performance that became exhausting. I was in survival mode, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other, hoping I wouldn’t get found out. I refused to see myself as disabled, and resisted using a white stick, but once I eventually did, I found people saw my disability before they saw me. I felt a total loss of identity. And I stopped doing the cultural things that once brought me joy. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The watershed summit in 2015 was far from perfect, but its impact so far has been significant and measurableTen years on from the historic Paris climate summit, which ended with the world’s first and only global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, it is easy to dwell on its failures.

Now he seems determined to set the terms for one of the biggest media deals in history.It’s a deal that could have repercussions not just in the US, but across the world, with not just the future of Hollywood at stake but also the landscape of news.

                    <p class="content-text">From pie-and-mash to the swank of a Michelin star, everyone has their own idea of what’s ‘best’. What’s yours?Jonathan Nunn is the author of London Feeds ItselfAlmost 24 years ago, a small British food magazine called Restaurant assembled an all-star panel – made up of Gordon Ramsay, John Torode, Aldo Zilli and 65 other food guys – to adjudicate on the world’s most stupid question: what is the best restaurant on the planet? It didn’t matter that no judge had been to all the restaurants on the shortlist, or that two of the judges happened to be Jeremy Clarkson and Roger Moore – what the editors of Restaurant understood is that people love a list, and if you order a group of restaurants from 50-1 and throw a party, people might take it seriously.“This could run and run,” the editors wrote in their intro, half hoping. They were right. Within two decades, The World’s 50 Best Restaurants had gone from what critic Jay Rayner described as a “terribly successful marketing exercise” to an insurgent alternative to the ossified Michelin Guide, solidifying the reputations of El Bulli, the Fat Duck and then Noma as the “world’s best restaurant”.Jonathan Nunn is a food and city writer based in London who co-edits the magazine Vittles.

A 23-minute rollercoaster, it pits a blackguardly timpanist and his stick-wielding allies against a devil-may-care hornist and his brassy backup band. The horn player enters from off stage, the timpanist stalks off in a huff, and somewhere in the middle, for no immediately discernible reason, a phoenix soars aloft in an iridescent haze of tuned percussion. Pappano and the London Symphony Orchestra gave it a thorough workout with marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, xylophone and tubular bells creating a magical aura. The musicians certainly revelled in its prickly harmonies, though the theatrical elements might have been pushed further. Continue reading...</p>

But this week it came to a head in a flurry of meetings, calls and one heady statement. Twenty-seven European countries urged a rethink of the human rights laws forged after the second world war, describing them as an impediment when it came to addressing migration.Amnesty International has called it “a moral retreat”. Europe’s most senior human rights official said the approach risked creating a “hierarchy of people” where some are seen as more deserving of protection than others. Continue reading...</p>

Through it all, the hot tip for Sports Personality of the Year has kept a cool headAt the end of last year, Chloe Kelly was seriously considering stepping away from football. She was deeply unhappy at Manchester City, her team since 2020, where it seemed as if they wouldn’t let her play, nor let her leave. She wasn’t getting enough time on the pitch, so wasn’t sure that she would be selected for England, who were preparing to defend the title she had helped win in 2022 in the Euros tournament. She was 26, about to turn 27. She had been a professional footballer since she was 18, but her mother was starting to get concerned. She desperately wanted her daughter to be happy again. “I remember my mum coming up to see me and she was meant to go home, but she didn’t go home, because she was so worried,” recalls Kelly.Less than a year later, and things are very different. At the time of writing, Kelly is favourite to win Sports Personality of the Year after a history-making comeback. At the end of January, she was loaned to Arsenal and in May she lifted the Champions League trophy with the team, very much the underdogs in the final against Barcelona, whom they defeated 1-0. At the end of July, she scored that penalty for England, securing them a second Euros title, against arch-rivals Spain. She was fifth in the Ballon D’or Féminin, and named in the Fifpro World 11 squad for the first time – a peer-voted list of the best footballers in the world. Against the odds, then, 2025 has turned out to be a great year. “For sure,” Kelly smiles. “To bounce back, that’s what makes it the best year of my career.” Continue reading...</p>

We embedded with Lancashire county council to find out what happens when rhetoric meets reality22 May 2025: a new dawn for Lancashire. Outside Preston’s grand old county hall, 53 brand new Reform UK councillors in turquoise ties – and one petite woman with an enormous turquoise hair bow – are hot-footing it past a gaggle of protesters for their first full council meeting. Most keep their heads down and get into the building as quickly as possible. But Joel Tetlow, a first-time politician who has made a few unfortunate headlines before even taking his seat, is intrigued. He stands in the doorway, vaping, as a demonstrator bellows: “Reform is a far right party and Nigel Farage is a racist and a fascist!”Tetlow – late 40s with a full head of vertiginous hair, wearing a powder-blue three-piece suit – insists he isn’t bothered. “They don’t know us as people,” he shrugs. “It’s a word that’s slung around now so much, to be a racist. You know, what is it to be a racist? All we want to do is stand for our country, look after the people within it. So we’re not racist. None of us are racist.” (Farage, too, has denied accusations of racism, and Reform dispute that they are a far right party.) Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Neath, south Wales: Rock from this quarry built the abbey and the terraced towns. A huge cliff collapse made it even more worthy of investigationThe way to Neath Abbey Quarry is a perfect stranger to me this morning. It’s been three years since my last visit, and the maze of the path has shifted; old tree trunks have turned to mulch and the brook carves a different channel. My companion and I shoulder big bouldering pads, poorly proportioned for tight manoeuvres, yet we bump, turn and pivot our way through. Thanks to the late sunrise, we’re gifted a lingering coda of the dawn chorus, coming from a holly thicket heavy with berries. A goldcrest fizzes around ahead of us, seeking bugs startled by our approach.Like every old quarry, this place has been host to much change. Once it was just a plain old hill, then a source of building blocks for monks and their abbey. Much later, it was extracted again for the terraced towns of the south Wales coalfield.

But she is previewing a revival of his Indian Ink, so he shimmers through the conversation. The way Kendal refers to Stoppard in the present tense tells its own poignant story.Settling into a squishy brown sofa at Hampstead theatre, Kendal describes revisiting the 1995 work, developed from a 1991 radio play. “It’s a play that I always thought I’d like to go back to.” Previously starring as Flora Crewe, a provocative British poet visiting 1930s India, she now plays Eleanor Swan, Flora’s sister.

The US has amassed its largest military presence in the Caribbean since the 1989 invasion of Panama. It has carried out more than 20 shocking strikes on alleged drug boats.

Please do not strike at this moment of crisis for the NHSKeir Starmer has said it is “frankly beyond belief” that resident doctors would strike during the NHS’s worst moment since the pandemic, in remarks that risk inflaming tensions with medics.Writing for the Guardian, the prime minister made an outspoken attack on the strikes planned for 17-22 December for placing “the NHS and patients who need it in grave danger”.

I no longer have the dread of weekends and holidays with insurmountable mountains of work. The move to a four-day teaching week would need to be thought about carefully.I, for one, would not want to have one full day out of school – this would mean four straight days of teaching. In most schools, a day not teaching would equate to five planning, preparation and assessment periods (PPAs). Continue reading...</p>

One aspect he did not mention was the strategic nuclear balance. Since the late 1940s, responsibility for deterrence has always lain with the Pentagon and has succeeded in keeping the peace, though at times a very fragile version of it.The recent US statement on defence makes it clear that Europe is no longer seen as a priority by the Trump administration, the danger now being that doubt is crucially being raised as to the credibility of Nato’s deterrent. Without certainty of a reaction in kind, Russia, under its ambitious and risk-taking president, might be tempted to chance its arm in what almost looks like a ceding of Europe by the US into a Russian “sphere of influence”.

I spent more than 30 years working on the prototype – the large complex of buildings that the architects Chamberlin, Powell and Bon designed for the University of Leeds, constructed circa 1970.All of the design features in the Barbican were there in the Leeds complex of offices, laboratories, library and so on, including all the problems. I always explained to visitors that I regarded the Chamberlin buildings primarily as a large-scale piece of brutalist sculpture rather than as a working environment. Continue reading...</p>

Movements from a suite by the long-forgotten French composer Jacques Duphly followed without a break.

                    <p class="content-text">The US made it clear this week that it plans to help the parties of the European far right gain power. Keir Starmer and his fellow leaders have to face this new realityWhen are we going to get the message? I joked a few months back that, when it comes to Donald Trump, Europe needs to learn from Sex and the City’s Miranda Hobbes and realise that “He’s just not that into you”. After this past week, it’s clear that understates the problem. Trump’s America is not merely indifferent to Europe – it’s positively hostile to it. That has enormous implications for the continent and for Britain, which too many of our leaders still refuse to face.The depth of US hostility was revealed most explicitly in the new US national security strategy, or NSS, a 29-page document that serves as a formal statement of the foreign policy of the second Trump administration. There is much there to lament, starting with the sceptical quote marks that appear around the sole reference to “climate change”, but the most striking passages are those that take aim at Europe.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    <p class="content-text">The MagentaTV app is now available on Hisense smart TVs running the VIDAA operating system, giving users direct access to Deutsche Telekom’s streaming platform without the need for external reception devices. The rollout comes with an eye on the FIFA World Cup 2026, for which MagentaTV will hold exclusive live rights to all matches in Germany. By integrating the app directly into VIDAA, Hisense TV owners will be able to follow the entire tournament live on their smart TVs, provided their devices run VIDAA OS version U6 or higher. “With anticipation for the FIFA World Cup 2026 already building, this is excellent news. By integrating the MagentaTV app, we are enhancing our smart TV interface with a leading German premium content provider. For retailers and end customers alike, this represents a clear upgrade to our entertainment offering and an additional level of convenience. For football fans, it offers a unique opportunity in 2026 to immerse themselves even more deeply in the tournament and not miss a single match,” said Sühel Semerci, Managing Director of Hisense Gorenje Germany. VIDAA CEO Guy Edri added: “The integration of MagentaTV is an important step in our mission to deliver an outstanding entertainment experience to users in Germany. Together with Deutsche Telekom, we are laying the foundations for an optimal user experience. We are currently working on the launch of our new operator TV solution, a next-generation product designed to further simplify access to television and entertainment.” From the MagentaTV side, Dr Jörg Richartz, Vice President Marketing & Sales, said the launch marks the start of a broader collaboration: “We are very pleased to be taking this first step on our joint journey with VIDAA and to further develop our app towards a complete MagentaTV experience. This partnership sets us on a highly innovative path within the industry.” According to both companies, the cooperation reflects a shared ambition to simplify the television experience by bringing linear TV and streaming services together within a single, intuitive user interface. Further product developments, deeper integrations and an expansion into additional European markets are planned.</p>

Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall is currently occupied by a feeble installation that would be weak in an ordinary-sized art space, let alone this gigantic one. It’s become genuinely hard to understand what Tate’s priorities are when it chooses artists for the annual Turbine Hall commission. And the Turner prize is even more mystifying. Once the stage of shocking, provocative art that engaged – whether they were for or against – a massive public, it has retreated into wilful obscurity, its trips around the UK starting to seem part of a studied wholesomeness. What’s the point of staging it in Bradford when the shortlist just exports the enigmatic tastes of a metropolitan elite?Is Maria Balshaw, who is quitting her post as director of Tate, solely responsible for this? No, but perhaps she is courageously taking the blame and allowing the institution to reinvent itself as it needs to, fast. The achievements Tate stresses in its announcement of her departure centre on how she has “diversified” the collection, exhibition and audiences.
