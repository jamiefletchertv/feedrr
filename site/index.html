                    <p class="content-text">The Bundesliga has entered the UK and Irish markets with a dedicated FAST Channel on Samsung TV Plus, offering free live and on-demand coverage of Germany’s top football leagues. The channel marks the league’s first foray into Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV in the region and forms part of a multi-year partnership between the Bundesliga and Samsung TV Plus. The move expands the league’s footprint at a time when interest in German football is rising, especially as England’s captain Harry Kane continues to make waves in the league ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026. Viewers will be able to watch all Friday-night Bundesliga fixtures live, beginning with tonight’s match between Mainz and Borussia Mönchengladbach (19:30 GMT). The service will also carry one live Bundesliga 2 match in each kick-off slot throughout the weekend. Beyond live games, the channel will run 24/7 with highlights, classic matches, documentaries, press conferences, behind-the-scenes features and extensive archive material from one of the sport’s largest media libraries. “With a Bundesliga channel on Samsung TV Plus, we’re taking another step in how the Bundesliga can be experienced in the UK: free, live and closer than ever before. This launch shows that the Bundesliga doesn’t just talk about innovation – we deliver it,” said Peer Naubert, CEO of Bundesliga International. Samsung TV Plus, available subscription-free on Samsung TVs, Galaxy devices and Samsung Smart Monitors, hosts the channel with technical distribution support from Wurl, a FAST platform service provider. According to Bundesliga, the partnership forms part of a broader strategy to expand its digital presence and increase accessibility for international fans.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Hispasat and Portuguese operator NOS have renewed their multi-year agreement for satellite TV distribution across Portugal, including the Azores and Madeira, extending a DTH partnership that has been in place for more than 20 years. Under the new contract, Hispasat will continue to use capacity from its 30° West orbital position to deliver NOS’s satellite platform, carrying more than 100 national and international TV channels. The service underpins universal TV coverage for NOS, reaching homes in rural and hard-to-serve areas where terrestrial reception is limited. NOS says satellite remains essential to “deliver everything to everyone” in Portugal, with DTH subscribers still concentrated in less densely populated regions where it can guarantee signal stability and quality. Hispasat describes the renewal as reinforcing a “strategic relationship” in the Iberian market. Joao Ferreira, director at NOS, said the operator’s audiovisual offer has relied on Hispasat “for decades” and that the renewed agreement ensures it can continue to provide service “even in the most remote areas”. Hispasat CCO Ignacio Sanchis called it “a great satisfaction” to retain NOS’s trust for its DTH services.</p>

The sports network will be the only subscription-TV channel in Portugal to carry the full tournament, which runs from 11 June to 19 July 2026 in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Sport TV says it will show every game from the group phase through to the final, with a World Cup-focused schedule running for the full 39 days of competition. Flagship channel SPORT.TV1 will switch to a dedicated World Cup format, carrying 92 live matches and close to 1,000 hours of coverage, including studio programming around Portugal’s national team. The remaining 12 fixtures will be shown on SPORT.TV2, with additional content and highlights offered across the broadcaster’s seven-channel line-up and digital platforms. Local reports indicate that 34 of the 104 matches will also air free-to-air in Portugal, in line with past tournaments where games involving the national team and key knockout ties have been sublicensed to terrestrial broadcasters. Pay-TV exclusivity will therefore apply to 70 fixtures, primarily outside Portugal’s matches and the highest-profile games. Sport TV chief executive Nuno Ferreira Pires said the deal extends a World Cup relationship that goes back more than two decades and described the 2026 edition as “special”, with expectations high around another deep run for Portugal in what could be the last World Cup for several star players. Sport TV’s acquisition follows FIFA’s 2024 invitation to tender for rights in Portugal and sits alongside a separate package awarded to LiveMode, which is understood to be preparing digital and YouTube coverage of part of the tournament. The combination reinforces Sport TV’s position as the leading premium football outlet in the market while ensuring broad distribution of selected matches via free platforms.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Canal+ has completed its long-trailed move into the Hungarian retail market with the launch of a dedicated Canal+ streaming service, replacing the Direct One consumer brand and deepening its partnership with 4iG. The Canal+ app went live in Hungary on 1 December 2025, offering a hybrid line-up that mixes live TV channels with on-demand films and series in a single environment tailored to the local market. Canal+ content had previously been sold in Hungary through the M7-owned Direct One platform, which itself evolved out of UPC Direct. The new service aggregates local and international linear channels and a catalogue of European and international movies and series, reflecting the Canal+ Group strategy of positioning its Central European platforms as curated, “European DNA” streaming offers with integrated live TV. Canal+ is drawing on StudioCanal and SPI International libraries to bolster the line-up. The launch coincides with the transfer of Direct One’s satellite TV base and B2B activities to Hungarian telecoms group 4iG. Following regulatory clearance, 4iG’s One Hungary unit has begun migrating Direct One satellite households onto its own TV packages, while Canal+ focuses on the OTT front end and branded pay-TV proposition. Canal+ and 4iG first outlined the Hungarian plan in July 2024, flagging that a standalone Canal+ app would arrive in 2025 and that Direct One’s role would shift to 4iG’s control. The 1 December switch marks the completion of that roadmap, giving Canal+ a unified D2C streaming foothold in another Central European market alongside Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Netherlands. Canal+ says it will continue to work with 4iG/One Hungary to distribute the new service on bundled terms, tapping the operator’s fixed and mobile footprint to grow penetration.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Netflix has struck a definitive agreement to acquire Warner Bros, including its film and TV studios, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service, in a cash-and-stock deal that values the business at an enterprise value of around $82.7 billion (€71.0 billion).  The deal will close after WBD completes the previously announced separation of its Global Networks division into a new, publicly traded company, Discovery Global, now expected in Q3 2026.  Under the terms of the transaction, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shareholders will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 (€3.9) in Netflix stock for each WBD share, valuing the company at $27.75 (€23.8) per share and implying total equity value of approximately $72.0 billion (€61.8 billion). Netflix and WBD expect the acquisition to close 12–18 months after the spin-off, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. The acquisition hands Netflix control of one of Hollywood’s most familiar studios and its portfolio of premium brands and franchises. Warner Bros properties including The Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, the DC Universe, Harry Potter and Friends will ultimately sit alongside Netflix originals such as Stranger Things, Squid Game, Money Heist and Bridgerton under a single corporate roof. Netflix said it intends to maintain Warner Bros’ current operations, including theatrical releases, and use its global streaming footprint to extend the reach of the studio’s IP. HBO and HBO Max are positioned as a “complementary” premium offering inside Netflix’s future portfolio, rather than as a standalone rival service. While branding and packaging details have yet to be confirmed, Netflix is signalling a multi-tier approach that folds HBO’s series into broader streaming plans, with more scope to bundle libraries and windowing across its global service. The company is targeting $2–3 billion (€2.1–2.6 billion) in annual cost savings by year three and says the transaction should be accretive to earnings per share by the second year after closing. Discovery Global, the networks spin-off that sits outside the Netflix deal, will retain WBD’s linear and sports businesses including CNN, TNT Sports in the United States, Discovery-branded entertainment channels, European free-to-air outlets and streaming products such as Discovery+ and Bleacher Report. That structure effectively separates legacy cable and global channels from the studio and streaming assets Netflix is buying, and preserves an independent pay-TV and news portfolio for future consolidation moves. The agreement caps a months-long bidding war in which Paramount Skydance and Comcast also tabled offers. Paramount had been pursuing a full takeover of WBD, including CNN and the cable networks, while Netflix and Comcast focused on the studio and streaming operations. Reports over recent weeks suggested Netflix’s mostly cash proposal had moved into pole position, with WBD’s board ultimately backing the Netflix structure over rival bids. Paramount has already complained publicly about a “tilted” auction process and could still explore hostile options, though control of Warner Bros is now contractually committed to Netflix unless regulators intervene. The deal will now face intense scrutiny from competition authorities in the United States, Europe and other key markets, given the combination of Netflix’s global streaming scale with HBO’s premium subscription base and the Warner Bros studio. Lawmakers and industry groups have already flagged concerns about market concentration during the earlier bidding phase, and Netflix has prepared for a lengthy review process. </p>

                    <p class="content-text">Netflix has revealed that the AV1 open video codec now accounts for about 30% of all viewing on its platform, and is on course to become its most-used compression format “very soon”. The update comes in a new Netflix Tech Blog post reviewing the company’s AV1 rollout across devices and regions. AV1 was first deployed on Android mobile in 2020 using the dav1d software decoder, before expanding to smart TVs and other large screens in late 2021, web browsers in 2022, and Apple hardware starting with the A17 Pro and M3 chips in 2023. Netflix says 88% of large-screen devices submitted for certification between 2021 and 2025 support AV1, with almost all devices since 2023 capable of AV1 playback, typically up to 4K at 60fps. The streamer reports that AV1 now delivers higher perceived quality while reducing traffic on its Open Connect CDN and partner ISP networks. On average, AV1 streaming sessions achieve VMAF scores 4.3 points higher than AVC and 0.9 points higher than HEVC, while using one-third less bandwidth than both, leading to 45% fewer buffering interruptions. Netflix says the gains apply across its catalogue, from drama series to animation. Netflix is also using AV1 to underpin new premium features. AV1-based HDR streaming, launched in March 2025 using HDR10+ dynamic metadata, now covers about 85% of its HDR catalogue by viewing hours, with full coverage expected “within the next couple of months”. In July 2025 the company productised AV1 Film Grain Synthesis, stripping grain before encoding and reconstructing it on playback; Netflix claims this can cut bitrate by around two-thirds versus a conventional AV1 encode while delivering better-looking cinematic grain. So far, AV1 is mainly used for on-demand streaming, but Netflix says it is actively evaluating the codec for live events and cloud gaming, citing potential benefits for mass concurrent audiences and for layered graphics overlays in sports coverage. Looking ahead, the company points to AV2, the next-generation open codec that the Alliance for Open Media plans to finalise by the end of 2025, as the likely next step in its compression roadmap.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">MultiChoice has warned DStv subscribers that a slate of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) channels could be removed from its platform from 1 January 2026 if the two companies fail to agree new distribution terms. In a note familiar to many pay-TV subscribers, Multichoice this week told its customers that its current carriage agreement with WBD expires on 31 December 2025 and that, with a month to go, no renewal has been finalised. The stand-off raises the prospect that up to 12 WBD services – spanning entertainment, lifestyle, kids and documentary genres – could disappear from DStv bouquets at the start of next year.T MultiChoice stressed that negotiations are continuing and framed the talks in terms of pricing and value, telling subscribers that “every time you subscribe, you trust us with your money”, and that it takes that responsibility seriously. The group has been under pressure to contain costs and maintain margins amid subscriber losses and a tougher economic environment across several African markets. At the same time, the operator moved to reassure viewers that DStv already carries a broad mix of local and international channels across all genres and said it is preparing to expand its line-up in 2026 with additional services and content offerings. Even if WBD networks do come off the platform, MultiChoice said subscribers would continue to have “strong alternative channels across every genre” and that it remains focused on delivering a “rich, diverse and enjoyable” viewing experience.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Authorities in Germany have carried out coordinated raids across three federal states as part of an investigation into a suspected organised pay-TV piracy network. The action targeted four men aged between 41 and 51 accused of large-scale card-sharing and the illegal provision of IPTV services. According to the public prosecutor’s office in Dessau-Roßlau and the State Criminal Police Office (LKA) of Saxony-Anhalt, searches were conducted on 2 December 2025 in Magdeburg and Lutherstadt Wittenberg, as well as in Delitzsch (Saxony) and Heldenstein (Bavaria). The investigation centres on allegations of commercial and gang-related computer fraud within the cybercrime domain. Investigators believe the suspects unlawfully shared pay-TV smartcards from a major provider over several years, distributing access to a large number of users via the internet. The resulting financial damage to rights holders is estimated to be at least in the mid-six-figure Euro range. During the raids, police seized extensive evidence, including computer systems, satellite receivers, IPTV boxes, servers, data storage devices and smartphones. Officers also performed live forensic captures of volatile data on external servers and were able to shut down illegal card sharing servers immediately. The investigation is ongoing, the authorities said.</p>
