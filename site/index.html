She had tried conventional mental health services but “chat”, as she came to know her AI “friend”, felt safer, less intimidating and, crucially, more available when it came to handling the trauma from the deaths of her young friends.As she started consulting the AI model, the Tottenham teenager joined about 40% of 13- to 17-year-olds in England and Wales affected by youth violence who are turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, according to research among more than 11,000 young people.

Now they are fighting backLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed a Snapchat post by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this. These fisha accounts are really not OK. Girls, please protect yourselves.’ And I’m like: ‘What is fisha?’ I was 21, but I felt old,” she says.She went into her sister’s bedroom, where her sibling showed her a Snapchat account named “fisha” plus the code of their Paris suburb. Fisha is French slang for publicly shaming someone – from the verb “afficher”, meaning to display or make public. The account contained intimate images of girls from her sister’s school and dozens of others, “along with the personal data of the victims – their names, phone numbers, addresses, everything to find them, everything to put them in danger”.

Populists bent on weakening the rule of law, rolling back human rights protections, subjugating the judiciary and cowing independent journalism are amplified by anything-goes social media algorithms that promote anger and polarisation over rational discourse.They have now received a mandate from the Trump administration, which effectively declared civilisational war on the EU and its values in its National Security Strategy.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy Centre Continue reading...</p>

Yet the mining company says the alternative will be worseA small brown line snakes its way through the rainforest in northern Sumatra, carving 300 metres through dense patches of meranti trees, oak and mahua. Picked up by satellites, the access road – though modest now – will soon extend 2km to connect with the Tor Ulu Ala pit, an expansion site of Indonesia’s Martabe mine. The road will help to unlock valuable deposits of gold, worth billions of dollars in today’s booming market. But such wealth could come at a steep cost to wildlife and biodiversity: the extinction of the world’s rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutan.The network of access roads planned for this swath of tropical rainforest will cut through habitat critical to the survival of the orangutans, scientists say. The Tapanuli (Pongo tapanuliensis), unique to Indonesia, was only discovered by scientists to be a separate species in 2017 – distinct from the Sumatran and Bornean apes. Today, there are fewer than 800 Tapanulis left in an area that covers as little as 2.5% of their historical range. All are found in Sumatra’s fragile Batang Toru ecosystem, bordered on its south-west flank by the Martabe mine, which began operations in 2012. Continue reading...</p>

However, LegCo elections have become devoid of meaningful opposition as Hong Kong has faced significant political repression and undergone major governance system overhauls in recent years.When the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, a “one country, two systems” framework promised Hong Kong would retain its autonomy, but its freedoms and democracy have been gradually eroded.

And in Starcy I have another legend to admireGrowing up in the late 1990s, I insisted my younger nephews and nieces call me Imran Khan instead of my real name – our own playful twist on traditional respect rituals. A few years later, I upgraded to Wasim Akram (naturally) and they obligingly followed. They’re all grown now, but they still call me “Mama Khan” or “Wasin Akral”- the clumsy childhood pronunciations that stuck to me the way cricket has.Last week, witnessing the magnificent Mitchell Starc overtake Akram as the leading left arm wicket-taker, made me pause – isn’t it about time for another upgrade?

                    <p class="content-text">Russell Bentley, 63, was grabbed and tortured by soldiers who thought he was spying for Ukraine; $800m US arms shortfall, says Zelenskyy. What we know on day 1,385Three Russian soldiers were sentenced to up to 12 years in prison on Monday for torturing and killing Russell Bentley, a 63-year-old US national who had volunteered to fight for Russia against Ukraine. Bentley went missing in April 2024 near Russian-controlled Donetsk after his wife said he had gone out in the aftermath of shelling by Ukrainian forces. Investigators said the soldiers beat and tortured him to death, then tried to hide the crime by blowing up his body in a car. A military court in Donetsk gave two soldiers 12-year sentences and a third 11 years. The case embarrassed Moscow – which has lured foreigners to fight on its side – while attracting derision from pro-Ukrainian observers about the treatment westerners could expect if they volunteered to fight for the Kremlin. Russian authorities tried to portray it as a tragic one-off.Nicknamed the “Donbas Cowboy”, Bentley was featured in a 2022 Rolling Stone article about his transformation from Texas leftist to “pro-Putin propagandist”, and, prior to the 2022 invasion, in Shaun Walker’s 2015 Guardian article about anti-Ukrainian rebels in the Donbas. He had obtained Russian citizenship and had done some work for the Russian state-controlled Sputnik news service. The court heard that the soldiers found Bentley near a military repairs facility preparing to film the aftermath of the Ukrainian attack. They disregarded his explanation that he was a journalist, put a sack over his head, and beat and tortured him to death, it said. A photograph published in some Russian media on Monday showed him sitting on a bed next to an assault rifle, with a pro-Russian flag, a souvenir from Texas and a bust of Vladimir Lenin.Ukraine is short of about $800m for US weapons that it had planned to buy this year with help from its European allies, according to Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president reiterated that for next year, Ukraine would need about $15bn for the Purl programme, which involves purchases of US weapons with European money.Eleni Courea, Jennifer Rankin and Peter Beaumont write that EU leaders will meet on 18 and 19 December in an attempt to sign off on a long-awaited European Commission proposal to funnel £78bn into a “reparations loan” that would go to Kyiv next year, funded by frozen Russian funds. In London on Monday, Zelenskyy met with European leaders Keir Starmer of Britain, Emmanuel Macron of France and Friedrich Merz of Germany. They were joined on a call by leaders of seven other European countries, a senior representative from Turkey, and Nato and EU chiefs. Continue reading...</p>

This film asks a lot of questions about her contemptible inner circle – but fails to get to the bottom of the tragedyThe death of the Friends star Matthew Perry was described as “sudden” on CBS News. In truth, it was decades in the making. Perry, by his own admission, was an alcoholic by the age of 14. Throughout his prodigiously successful acting career, he was engaged in a losing battle with various addictions.

In his memoir, he had this to say about ketamine: “[It] has my name written all over it. They might as well have called it ‘Matty’.”Jasveen Sangha is an MBA student turned drug dealer from Essex who ended up in Hollywood, labelled the Ketamine Queen. Did she sell Perry the drugs that killed him? This documentary exploring the circumstances around Perry’s death is the work of Amber Haque, who, among other things, is the co-host of the true-crime podcast Bad People.

                    <p class="content-text">Deutsche Telekom will enter the FAST Channel business on its German TV platform MagentaTV this month, marking the telco’s first major push into free ad-supported streaming as it gears up for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The new portfolio of FAST channels – spanning film, entertainment, docutainment, sport and lifestyle – will roll out from December and is set to grow to as many as 40 channels by the time the football tournament begins in June 2026. Telekom says the line-up will significantly expand MagentaTV’s reach beyond its established live sports offering and attract broader streaming audiences. The move comes as MagentaTV also opens its advertising inventory for programmatic buying for the first time. Agencies and advertisers will gain access to premium placements across the platform, including in the exclusive live sports environments that Telekom expects to deliver high viewership during the World Cup. MagentaTV will show all 104 matches of the tournament, including 44 exclusively, with live coverage blocks of up to 12 hours per matchday. “Streaming and CTV are no longer side channels but premium environments offering brand reach, relevance and precise targeting,” said Dr Jörg Richartz, Vice President Sales & Marketing TV at Deutsche Telekom. “With MagentaTV, we are now making our exclusive inventory accessible programmatically, supported by our own data and innovative targeting options.” Richartz said the upcoming FAST Channel portfolio will give advertisers new opportunities to reach viewers beyond live sport, while Telekom’s in-house sales team will offer classic TV and CTV spots, special ad formats and customised sponsorships. The programmatic infrastructure is being developed in partnership with ad-tech service provider Equativ. “MagentaTV stands for premium entertainment and content you won’t find anywhere else,” Richartz added. “By working with strong partners like Equativ, we’re creating a monetisation ecosystem that brings programmatic efficiencies to our platform.”</p>

                    <p class="content-text">US pressure over Ukraine has revealed Sir Keir Starmer’s limitations and a British state too hollowed out to shape events at home or abroadThe bullying of Ukraine by the Trump White House has exposed Sir Keir Starmer as a prime minister adrift in shifting geopolitics. Unable to describe Britain’s position, he managed only a hope of “lasting” peace. This reveals a British state that has been hollowed out, as well as the diminishing returns of a political order built for another age. For decades, UK leaders assumed that the US would underwrite Europe’s security; that, as Washington’s closest ally, Britain would punch above its weight; and that British institutions would stabilise order, if not justice, in turbulent times. That world has gone.Monday’s Downing Street summit with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, threw the dilemma that Sir Keir faces into sharp relief. Mr Macron could speak of the cards in Europe’s hand; Germany’s leader could voice scepticism about American proposals. Even Mr Zelenskyy, fighting for national survival, could pithily articulate why he needed both Europe and the US. Each spoke from within a political system that, however imperfect, has begun adapting to a post-American world. Britain has not – and, under its present leadership, shows little inclination to even envision one. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Sun-dimming risks putting the planet’s thermostat under Donald Trump’s control. Better to adopt the precautionary principle with high-stakes scienceIt is fitting that this week’s UN environment talks are in Nairobi, with Africa shaping the global climate conversation. The continent’s diplomats are dealing with the vexed question of whether it is wise to try to cool the planet by dimming the sun’s rays. While not on the formal summit agenda, on the sidelines they are arguing that it’s time to stop promoting solar geoengineering technology as a solution to global heating. It’s hard to disagree.African nations have acted because they don’t want their continent to become a test bed for unproven schemes to spray particles into the high atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth for a small, uncertain cooling gain. They point to environmental, ethical and geopolitical risks. That’s why the continent is pushing for a global “non-use” agreement that would rule out public funding, outdoor experiments, patenting and official promotion of these technologies.

No Richard Linklater? This amazing director actually has two films in the “best musical or comedy” section (so I guess he can’t really be that depressed). There’s his amazingly witty and poignant chamber piece Blue Moon, with Globe-nominated Ethan Hawke playing depressed Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart, and his eerily accomplished pastiche-homage Nouvelle Vague, about the making of Godard’s classic Breathless, shot not in the boring old colour in which these events happened but in a beautifully realised monochrome – a little reverential for my tastes but still a marvellously accomplished picture.

Dark Horse, directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh and written by Mário Frias, who served as secretary of culture under Bolsonaro, started shooting three months ago in Brazil, where Bolsonaro served as president from 2019 until 2023. He was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison in September 2025 for leading a criminal conspiracy to stop his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking power, though his supporters deny the allegations and have compared the prosecution to the “lawfare” allegedly faced by Donald Trump before he was re-elected.

We all need better evidence, 4 December). Political point-scoring has no place in public health.By setting up this taskforce, Streeting acknowledges the complexity of the picture and that conversations must be led by research, where science and suffering can be held together.

Such events that hurt children or young people, whether words or actions, are remembered for the whole of a lifetime.

That was more than six decades ago, not four.Name and address supplied Continue reading...</p>

We knew that even if we’d paid our cheap mortgages off (lucky us), we would either have to downsize or have taken out our own pensions. We knew the state pension would never be enough.So we did. And if we were lucky, it covered the cracks. Except that when we retired, we were taxed again on our pensions, having already been taxed on the funds we used to take them out in the first place.

Timed to ruin holidays like a round of end-of-year layoffs, the streaming giant announced plans to buy Warner Bros, a movie and television studio with a full-century legacy. It’s possible that the acquisition won’t actually go through – and if it does, it won’t be for at least a year. But the news still looms over year-end awards and list-making, and it’s going to take more than a jingle-bell heist to steal back any holiday cheer for the entertainment industry, much less halt the march of corporate consolidation and monopolization. Even more depressing: the entity that seems most able to take action against this is … another attempted consolidation. Paramount has launched a bid for a hostile takeover of Warner Bros Discovery, which would bring two big studios under one extremely Trump-friendly umbrella. This would almost certainly further cull the number of wide-release movies released each year.Depression might not seem like a rational response, especially for anyone who doesn’t actually work in said industry. (There are plenty of reasons that various unions are making their opposition to either sale known.) Yet the news last week had hundreds of film fans posting eulogies and defenses not just of Warner Bros as a studio – which on its own includes a vast history encompassing classics like Casablanca, The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Departed, Bonnie and Clyde, The Searchers, and The Matrix, among hundreds – but the very fabric of theatrical moviegoing.

As you walk around, holograms appear; a man about to collapse, clinging to a wall with one hand; a woman leaning on a desk, such a plain image it could be any desk, but you know it’s a benefits office by her look of beseeching desperation; a man who has died in the street, his dog waiting for him to wake up. Approach any scene from the right angle, and the testimony of one of their relatives will start playing through the headsetIn 2022, a study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health estimated that there had been over 330,000 excess deaths caused by austerity, one way or another, between 2012 and 2019. It was public knowledge and yet it was somehow too large to wrap your mind around: did it mean the coalition and then Conservative governments knowingly let people die? Or was it more a case of, modern life was different, and governments no longer took responsibility for whether or not people died? That seemed like a narrative everyone was more comfortable with, that these were straitened times, and the state no longer made health and life its core business. But how is that different to letting people die? And how is it comfortable?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Starring Russell Tovey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jemma Redgrave, it features a radical overhaul of a Doctor Who monster first seen in Jon Pertwee’s era: the Sea Devils.The drama plays as an ecological thriller, with humanity’s mistreatment of the oceans used as a stick by the Sea Devils – now dubbed Homo aqua and Homo amphibia – to justify their demands. Tovey’s “everyman” character is thrust into the global spotlight as humanity’s representative in negotiations that feel increasingly impossible. Continue reading...</p>

Unless something utterly remarkable happens, Mohamed Salah has played his last game for Liverpool. Left out of the starting lineup for each of the last three matches, he trained on Monday after his extraordinary post-match tirade following the 3-3 draw with Leeds but he has not been selected for the Champions League against Inter on Tuesday. After that, he will be in Morocco for the Africa Cup of Nations with the Egypt national team and the transfer window will have opened by the time the tournament is over.How has it come to this? Salah is one of Liverpool’s all-time greats. He lies behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt in their all-time goal scoring charts. Across all clubs, only Alan Shearer, Harry Kane and Wayne Rooney have scored more Premier League goals. He played a key role in two Premier League titles and a Champions League. He’s won the Premier League Golden Boot four times and been named player of the year three times by both his fellow players and soccer writers – including last year. He’s only 33 and there has been no obvious sign yet of him fading with age. This is not the end anybody would have wanted. Continue reading...</p>

She gave thanks to the mayor for appointing her in 2023 and supporting her throughout her tenure, which she acknowledged had been both “challenging and rewarding”.Smith adds that “tremendous progress” has been made but the city is not at “zero percent crime” yet.I am confident that the department is in a strong position and that the great work will continue, moving in a positive trajectory to combat crime and enhance public safety. Washington, DC is an extraordinary place to live, visit, and work, and I remain inspired by the resilience and spirit of this community.I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve in this capacity as Chief of Police. It has been an honor to lead the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department, and I will always carry with the me the pride of having served this city.When Chief Smith stepped up to lead the Metropolitan Police Department, we had no time to waste. She came in at a very challenging time for our community, when there was significant urgency to reverse the crime trends our city was facing post pandemic. Within a year of her tenure, we opened the Real-Time Crime Center.We deployed newer and better technology.

Motability Check – run by an unknown third party and now offline – allowed members of the public to type in any number plate and (largely incorrectly) see if it was a car provided by the firm. The purpose appeared simple and disturbing: spot that neighbour who says they have a bad back and check with a few clicks if they are milking the taxpayer.From the spring, the idea that Motability was offering disabled people “free” BMWs and Mercedes began to spread. While the rightwing press suggested someone could get a vehicle for “bed wetting” and acne, blue tick accounts on X gleefully argued the only car available to claimants should be cheap, ugly and “have MOTABILITY written on it, preferably in neon”.

But in The Dead of Winter, the historian and folklorist Sarah Clegg reveals a lesser known side to the festive season, unearthing unsettling midwinter traditions and stories that fell out of favour in the Victorian age.Subtitled The Demons, Witches and Ghosts of Christmas, the book opens with Clegg embarking on a pre-dawn walk to a graveyard on Christmas Eve. She is recreating an old Swedish tradition called årsgång, or “year walk”, which is said to offer glimpses into the walker’s future along with “shadowy enactments of the burials of anyone who will die in the village this coming year”.Available via WF Howes, 4hr 21min Continue reading...</p>

These practical, expert-backed tips can help make silly season more sustainable• Where do all the products the Filter tests end up?Whether it’s the gift wrap (108m rolls discarded annually), the food (the average family wastes about £60 of it over the festive period) or the dreaded plastic packaging (more than 114,000 tonnes of it is discarded during Christmas in the UK), there is a lot of unnecessary festive stuff. According to Waste Direct, the UK produces 30% more waste at Christmas than at any other time of year.A few years ago, a family member started a conversation about finding Christmas overwhelming because they were receiving gifts they didn’t really want or need. That sparked a chain reaction whereby we now have a more considered Christmas, choosing presents more wisely (or not at all) and cutting down on the excess. I’ve taken this experience – which has been truly rewarding – plus the advice of experts, to explore easy and joyful ways to be less wasteful this Christmas. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal valuing the US media group at $108.4 billion (€93.1bn). The company, now part of Skydance Corporation is offering $30.00 per share for Warner Bros. Discovery, a 139% premium to WBD’s undisturbed share price of $12.54 on 10 September. The move directly challenges Warner Bros. Discovery’s recently announced transaction with Netflix, which would deliver $23.25 in cash plus stock valued at around $4.50 per share, while leaving WBD shareholders with an interest in a spun-off Global Networks business. Paramount’s proposal instead seeks to acquire the whole company. On Sunday Donald Trump warned the Netflix bid for WBD ‘could be a problem.’There’s already opposition in Hollywood to the streamer’s $54 billion bid.  “WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,” said David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount. The tender offer is currently scheduled to expire on 8 January 2026, unless extended. Paramount said it has filed pre-merger notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and is prepared to work through the regulatory approvals required. Paramount argues its fully funded cash offer provides greater certainty and a quicker path to closing than the Netflix structure, which it believes is already facing a protracted multi-jurisdictional regulatory review in markets where Netflix already has a strong position.</p>

Less than twenty-four hours later, two houses on his street would be lost, and its surrounding forest would be reduced to blackened skeletal remains.Morgan’s township of Bulahdelah, around 235km north of Sydney, has become at the centre of a tragedy after a veteran firefighter died on Sunday evening when he was struck by a falling tree, marking a “foreboding start” to the bushfire season.

Perhaps it was creator Jacob Tierney’s terse response to questions of his leading actors’ sexualities while on a recent promotional tour. Or that the show is based on a series of concupiscent novels by Canadian writer Rachel Reid that centre hockey (!), and which ride the current trend for “hate-to-love” romance driving the kids crazy.

One minute aloof Russian player Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) is making eyes at meek local champion Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams), the next they’re wanking in the shower together. Then getting blowjobs in classy hotel suites. Pretty soon, the boys are going at it hammer and tongs – broken at regular intervals by months-long ellipses, waiting for the hockey circuit to bring them back into each others’ arms. This is also convenient for sexual tension, which would otherwise have to be developed through character and dialogue. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">HSV are back in the Bundesliga and remain a huge club even if they have adjusted expectations this seasonAlexander Røssing-Lelesiit did not play for Hamburg in Sunday’s stellar win, and he will hope that his career has more decisive contributions than this one in store. As the final whistle went on a breathless Nordderby victory over Werder Bremen, the 18-year-old bobbed in front of the visitors’ bench and celebrated wildly, prompting some afters between the two squads in a game that bubbled excitedly without exploding into disorder. Those from Bremen were less than impressed. Justin Njinmah, who had looked like saving a point for Werder when equalising at 2-2 less than 10 minutes after coming on as a substitute, named no names but complained that “some injured HSV players ran onto the field and thought they had to gesticulate and talk shit. That pisses me off. But I guess that’s part of a derby.”Yes, this is a derby, and then some. Njinmah needed no reminding – he is from Hamburg after all – but there has been plenty of time to forget just how big this is. Sunday’s edition was the first top-flight Nordderby in 2,843 days, and it didn’t disappoint. If Werder’s goal to take the lead at the end of the first half, an ice-cold finish by Jens Stage, felt like it might have been transplanted from a different game, the blue touchpaper was really lit after the interval. Albert Sambi Lokonga levelled for Hamburg just after the hour, as the roof raised and the emotion started to flow. Continue reading...</p>

Despite being responsible for some of the films widely acknowledged to be the best of the century so far, including There Will Be Blood, The Master and Magnolia, the writer-director is yet to win an Oscar, Golden Globe or more than one Bafta (original screenplay for 2021’s Licorice Pizza).Monday’s Golden Globe nominations suggest this is about to change, with his countercultural epic One Battle After Another leading the pack of nominees with nine mentions on the shortlist, including for best comedy or musical, best director, best original screenplay, leading actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, leading actor for Chase Infinity, supporting actress for Teyana Taylor and two chances to scoop supporting actor – for Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro. Jonny Greenwood’s score was also recognised. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Public service media organisations from across Central and Eastern Europe have written to the Lithuanian Seimas warning that planned changes to the law governing public broadcaster LRT risk undermining its independence and breaching EU media freedom standards. In an open letter sent to parliamentary leaders, the government and the president’s office, members of the EBU Central and Eastern Europe Group say proposed amendments to the Law on LRT would weaken governance safeguards and stable financing. On 27 November, the Seimas backed at first reading changes that would allow the Director General to be dismissed by a simple majority of the LRT Council in a secret ballot, removing the requirement to justify dismissal in the public interest. A separate amendment would freeze LRT’s budget at its 2025 level until 2029, with tax-based funding reduced thereafter. The CEE broadcasters argue the proposals run counter to the EU’s new European Media Freedom Act, which requires that appointment and dismissal procedures for public media leadership protect editorial independence and guard against political interference. They also point to strong domestic criticism: the Lithuanian National Commission for UNESCO, journalists’ organisations and LRT’s own Council have all opposed the changes, while the Seimas Legal Department has warned they conflict with Constitutional Court doctrine. More than 100,000 citizens have signed a petition and a public protest is planned for 9 December. Describing LRT as one of the region’s most trusted public media brands, the signatories say weakening its protections would damage Lithuania’s democracy and set back media freedom standards across Central and Eastern Europe at a time of rising disinformation and polarisation. They call on MPs to drop the governance amendments, guarantee stable and adequate funding in line with EMFA obligations, and uphold Lithuania’s reputation as a democratic leader. The letter concludes with a declaration of full support for LRT, signed by 27 public service media organisations in the region.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Harmonic has agreed to sell its Video business to MediaKind in an all-cash deal worth approximately $145 million (€134.9m), in a move that will see the US vendor concentrate on its broadband activities. MediaKind has made a binding offer to acquire Harmonic’s Video Business segment, with completion expected in the first half of 2026, subject to French employee works council consultation, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Harmonic said the transaction would accelerate its long-term strategy by concentrating investment on its virtualised broadband business, while also strengthening its balance sheet and providing additional capital to support growth and shareholder returns. “This strategic transaction will, if completed, advance the growth strategies of both companies,” said Harmonic president and CEO Nimrod Ben-Natan. “It would allow Harmonic to zero in on its core Broadband segment, while ensuring the Video Business, its customers and dedicated employees become part of an organisation committed to the future of video delivery.” MediaKind CEO Allen Broome said combining the two operations would create “the leading independent streaming infrastructure company”, backed by an expanded and complementary R&D platform. “By joining Harmonic’s Video Business with MediaKind, we would strengthen our ability to invest across our entire portfolio… giving customers a stronger, more reliable partner to power the future of video,” he added. Harmonic has reaffirmed its full-company guidance for Q4 2025 and referred investors to its third-quarter results for further financial details.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Barb has launched the Barb Data Hub, a new cloud-based platform for storing, processing and distributing its viewing data to the UK TV and advertising industry. The system centralises all calculations used to create Barb’s DB2 daily viewing files, effectively codifying large parts of Barb’s methodology in a standardised and reusable way. Barb says this will cut duplication of effort among users and improve consistency of data outputs. Several of Barb’s newer initiatives are being built directly into the Hub. Prototypes for Barb Panel Plus, which extends the use of big datasets alongside panel data, are already integrated. The forthcoming Barb Ads Hub, an analytics system to support full-cycle campaign optimisation, will also sit within the platform when it launches in January 2026, as will the third phase of Barb’s API, due next year. Clients will continue to access viewing data via existing routes, including flat files from an sftp site, Barb’s API and through data-processing bureaux as part of the Barb Trusted Data Delivery Network. Additional ways of interacting with the Data Hub’s database and codebase are planned over time. “The Barb Data Hub sits at the core of our new data-distribution strategy, which seeks to offer our clients greater choice, ease of use and flexibility in how they access our trusted viewing data,” said Caroline Baxter, Barb’s chief operating officer. “The Data Hub will continue to evolve as we integrate our other initiatives into it, making it a comprehensive Barb data warehouse.” The platform has been set up, developed and is operated by global media advisor MediaSense, with Snowflake providing the underlying cloud data infrastructure.</p>

Luciano Spalletti had the club’s emblem inked on to his arm, together with a Scudetto badge, after leading the Partenopei to their third Serie A title in 2023. The design made it appear as though someone had torn into his flesh, revealing his true essence, a connection more than just skin deep.But then he accepted the manager’s job at Juventus. For many Napoli supporters this was the ultimate sin, joining the club they hate the most. From others there was a measure of understanding. Spalletti had been out of work for four months after being sacked by the Italian national team in the middle of an ailing World Cup qualifying campaign.

                    <p class="content-text">The DVB Project has released a new set of test streams to help manufacturers and service providers verify their implementations of service-prominence signalling in line with EU rules. The material, available free of charge from the Verification and Validation section of the DVB website, covers a range of configurations designed to support different implementation approaches. It is intended to ensure consistent handling of prominence requirements across DVB-based platforms. Under the EU’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), Article 7 requires that services of general interest – including public-value media – are made easy for viewers to find. DVB has updated its Service Information (DVB-SI) specification to support this, adding the Service Prominence Descriptor to the signalling used for service discovery and “now/next” information. Developed following a DVB Request for Proposals issued in November 2023, the new test streams allow implementers to exercise a variety of signalling scenarios, including service prioritisation and regionalisation, ahead of wider deployment.</p>

After they overcame a stubborn Leicester City side 3-0 on Sunday to claim a ninth straight win, it would appear the answer to that question is “significantly” compared to recent seasons, as they demonstrated a unity and a composure that has perhaps evaded many title hopefuls of old.

                    <p class="content-text">Russian state-backed news network RT has launched a dedicated India channel, RT India, timed to coincide with President Vladimir Putin’s state visit to New Delhi for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The service, broadcasting from studios in the Indian capital, was formally unveiled by Putin alongside RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simony. RT India will initially offer four daily news bulletins, documentaries and interviews with political, business and cultural figures. In a familiar RT formula, former Indian foreign minister Salman Khurshid is fronting the flagship geopolitical talk show, while RT India news chief Rungjun Sharma will host a weekly programme on bilateral ties. RT also plans to launch a dedicated Hindi-language news website in 2026, expanding beyond the predominantly English-language TV line-up. As part of Putin’s visit, RT signed an addendum to its Memorandum of Understanding with Indian public broadcaster Prasar Bharati, expanding cooperation on news content exchange, joint live coverage of major events and high-level visits, and wider expertise-sharing. Distribution details for RT India on Indian TV and streaming platforms have not yet been disclosed.  The launch comes against the backdrop of Western sanctions and bans on RT in the EU and UK, where regulators and governments have labelled the outlet a Kremlin propaganda arm. In India, the Modi government sees Putin’s visit as a reaffirmation of a “special and privileged strategic partnership”, even as it faces domestic criticism over Russia’s war in Ukraine and foreign pressure on its continued purchases of Russian oil. European and US officials are likely to view RT India as part of Moscow’s wider push to build media influence in the Global South and to challenge Western news brands already present in the Indian market.</p>

Under the new five-year contract, beIN will continue to use Ku-band capacity on the Eutelsat 7 West A and Eutelsat 8 West B satellites to distribute its premium sports and sports news services to millions of homes across the region. Eutelsat says the 7/8° West neighbourhood now reaches 95% of TV homes in MENA, with more than 66 million TV households and the largest line-up of premium regional and international broadcasters, confirming its status as the leading video neighbourhood in the region. Aymeric Genty, president of Eutelsat’s Video Business Unit, said the renewed deal would allow the companies to “continue to deliver world-class sports content to millions of viewers with the highest levels of reliability and quality”, underlining the strategic value of 7/8° West. Israel Esteban, chief technology officer at beIN Media Group, described DTH as the “dominant distribution platform” in MENA and said the new agreement builds on a successful seven-year collaboration, ensuring viewers in 24 countries continue to receive beIN Sports’ coverage of major global sports events via satellite.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Virgin Media O2 has added two music-focused FAST channels to its Virgin TV line-up, giving customers round-the-clock access to classical and jazz programming at no additional cost. Stingray Classica (channel 296) is dedicated to classical music, opera and ballet, featuring around 50 world premieres a year recorded at major concert halls, festivals and opera houses. The channel also carries documentaries, exclusive performances and weekly premieres aimed at both classical enthusiasts and newcomers. Stingray DJAZZ (channel 297) offers jazz concerts, films, artist portraits and documentaries from a range of venues and festivals, along with profiles, interviews and backstage reports. The new services are available to all Virgin TV customers via the set-top box EPG and join Virgin Media’s existing FAST line-up, which also includes British Screen Classics, U&Transport, Inside Crime and Haunt TV. “We are launching two brand new FAST channels to give our customers even more of the best entertainment Virgin TV has to offer,” said David Bouchier, chief TV and entertainment officer at Virgin Media O2. “From classical music to jazz concerts and artist interviews, the new channels offer something for all music fans to enjoy.” Virgin Media O2 said it will continue to expand its FAST portfolio, positioning the channels as a complementary offer alongside traditional linear TV.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Norway has passed six million paid streaming subscriptions for the first time, according to new figures from Mediavision – cementing its position as the most mature streaming market in the Nordics. The consultancy’s latest analysis of the Norwegian TV and streaming market shows subscriptions up 10% on autumn 2024, with 80% of households now taking at least one paid service, the highest share in the region. Price rises from several major services over the past year have not slowed the market. Instead, combined with the increase in subscriptions, they have pushed household video spend to a record level. On average, Norwegian homes now pay over NOK 670 (€57.62) per month for video services – up 10% year-on-year and again the highest figure in the Nordic countries. “Norway is clearly the highest in the Nordic region when it comes to the adoption of streaming services. The high household penetration reflects a continued strong willingness to pay for streaming,” said Fredrik Liljeqvist, chief analyst at Mediavision. He added that while market revenues are still growing strongly, subscription growth is expected to slow, increasing competitive pressure as players focus more heavily on winning – and keeping – existing consumers.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">When abuse occurs, the first instinct is too often containment. We know this pattern because we have seen it ourselvesFor years, Jeffrey Epstein conjured a kind of grotesque fascination: the private island, the powerful friends, the whispered allegations. But focusing on the lurid details of his life and eventual death obscures the far more unsettling truth his case lays bare. Epstein’s story is not really about one man’s depravity. It is about a system – legal, cultural, and institutional – engineered to protect the powerful through silence. His crimes thrived not because they were hidden, but because the people who knew were coerced, encouraged, or more than willing to shut up.Silence was not incidental to Epstein’s success. It was central to it. And in this, he was hardly unique.Gretchen Carlson is a journalist, bestselling author and internationally recognized advocate for women’s rights. Julie Roginsky is a champion of women’s rights and political consultant. Carlson and Roginsky co-founded the nonprofit Lift Our Voices, dedicated to eliminating silencing mechanisms like forced arbitration and NDAs for toxic workplace issues Continue reading...</p>

The reality is we’re all going to end up crammed into the same awful, environmentally disastrous metal tubeThe New Yorker has published a deliciously fact-stuffed long read on the airport lounge: there are more than 3,500 worldwide, of which 37 are in Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok. American Airlines opened the first in 1939 and called its VIP members “admirals”.There are almost more admirals than ordinary seamen now (a weird metaphor in an air travel context, yes; blame American Airlines). The “mostly low- and mid-tier” lounge network Priority Pass saw a 31% increase in usage last year, including me: my credit card came with this seemingly seductive perk. I was thrilled to join the global elite in what I imagined would be a cashmere and champagne cocoon, saved from the usual three hours (my husband is one of those travellers) crouched by a bin in the purgatorial wasteland of Manchester Terminal 3, nursing a half-frozen Boots falafel wrap.

Please help us reach our year-end fundraising goalOn election day last month, I spent some time interviewing poll workers in New York City.When I introduced myself to one, I told her that I write a column for the Guardian and her immediate reply was “thank you”. I was a little taken aback: people don’t normally react that way to journalists. Trust in the news media is low, and Donald Trump’s unfair cries of “fake news” and his efforts to depict journalists as “enemies of the people” have taken their toll. Continue reading...</p>

He posted a video on 5 September showing a new bronze plaque being affixed to his door reading: “Pete Hegseth Secretary of War.”His splendid new designation, not established by the Congress as required by law, was purely notional and performative, announced by Donald Trump in an executive order that carried no legal weight, but befitted Hegseth’s self-conceit as warrior-in-chief. He now had the title to go with the tattoos: the crusader cross; “Deus vult”, or “God wills it”, the crusader battle cry; the sniper rifle against the background of an American flag; and the cross and sword inspired by Matthew 10:34: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth.

                    <p class="content-text">Abandoned by his parents and fresh out of juvenile prison, the wide-eyed Wellington meets a charismatic hustler on the restless streets of São PauloChannelling the urban restlessness and vibrancy of São Paulo, Marcelo Caetano’s bracing drama centres on those who live on the fringes of an ever-changing metropolis. Fresh out of juvenile prison, 18-year-old Wellington (João Pedro Mariano) finds himself at a crossroads; abandoned by his parents, the wide-eyed young man finds solace in the arms of others. On an evening out with his rowdy group of queer and non-binary friends, Wellington crosses paths with Ronaldo (Ricardo Teodoro), a hunky, charismatic hustler more than twice his age. Bathed in the flickering glow of a neon-lit porn cinema, their first meeting is sensuous and erotic, with an edge of danger. Ronaldo quickly introduces Wellington to the shadowy world of sex work and drug dealing.Caetano depicts Wellington’s new life of crime with tender empathy rather than as a sensationalist cautionary tale. Now going by the name of Baby, he approaches his transactional encounters with cocky bravado and touching naivety. To his customers, Wellington lends not only his youth and his body, but also moments of care. In the feverish excitement of São Paulo, filled with bustling alleyways and colourful shopfronts, there’s a gnawing loneliness, as unmoored souls cling on to one another for momentary bliss.

                    <p class="content-text">Starmer to face questions over reports that local Labour groups have been asked who could lead party into next electionGood morning. The most significant event of the day will probably be the meeting that Keir Starmer is hosting in Downing Street for the E3 (the leaders of Britain, France and Germany), and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.There will be some mention of that here, but Jakub Krupa will be leading the coverage of that on his Europe live blog.50,000 young people across the country will be better equipped for jobs of the future through a major investment to create more apprenticeships and training courses.The £725m package of reforms to the apprenticeship system will help to tackle youth unemployment and drive economic growth, with thousands more young people expected to benefit over the next three years.A survey sent to local Labour parties, seen by The Times, prompted members to name the politicians who stood “the best chance of leading Labour to electoral victory at the next general election” compared with Starmer and to rank those they would be likely to vote for in a leadership election.Eight senior Labour politicians were named alongside Starmer. The five cabinet ministers in the survey are Wes Streeting, the health secretary; Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary; Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary; Ed Miliband, the energy secretary; and Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister.

Instead, working with non-professional actors and a story clearly premeditated enough to earn a credit for its authors (Kotevska and Suz Curtis), this blends folk tale, improvisation and mud-caked vérité to tell the story of a contemporary farming family, the Conevs, in economically depressed North Macedonia.Sixtysomething paterfamilias Nikola and his wife, Jana, have been growing watermelons, tomatoes and tobacco on the family land for years. However, the wholesale prices have recently dropped through the soil, prompting a mini riot by irate agricultural workers who take out their frustrations by destroying their own crops. Nikola and Jana’s daughter Ana decides to emigrate to Germany with her husband, taking their preschool-aged daughter with them, only to discover that most of their wages will be eaten up by childcare fees. They implore Jana to come out and be their childminder, leaving Nikola to try to sell the farmland for a pittance and find a job at a local landfill. Melancholy video-calls to the family abroad underscore his loneliness, but at least he has old mucker Ilija to talk to and share the odd bottle of hooch. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Arsenal feel effects of defensive injuries, Liverpool rue Konaté’s mistakes and Brentford struggle on the roadLatest Premier League table | Top scorersWhen the team sheets landed at Villa Park, Arsenal’s matchday squad again appeared imperious. Their bench included a £64m striker in Viktor Gyökeres, a trio of tricky wingers in Leandro Trossard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli and arguably England’s most exciting teenagers in Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri. But Arsenal arrived top-heavy, the only centre-back among the substitutes the 16-year-old Marli Salmon. By the time Emiliano Buendía clinched victory for Aston Villa with almost the final kick, it was clear Arsenal lacked the defensive solidity behind their pace-setting start; this defeat was only the fourth time since the start of 2022-23 that Mikel Arteta’s side began a league game without Gabriel Magalhães or William Saliba – and it showed. Cristhian Mosquera, potentially sidelined until the new year, was also absent. The good news for all parties – which probably extends to second-placed Manchester City – is that Arsenal and Villa will duke it out again on 30 December in the reverse fixture.

It is a strong antioxidant, helping protect cells from harmful unstable compounds that arise from toxins and pollution. It helps the body absorb iron, and is also used in the production of collagen. “But the idea that taking high doses of vitamin C – or drinking lots of orange juice – will stop you catching a cold, or help you recover faster, is a myth.”Davis, the author of Self Defence: A Myth-Busting Guide to Immune Health, explains that the popular belief in vitamin C’s cold-fighting powers has persisted for more than 50 years, “pretty much solely because of the evangelical view of one man: Linus Pauling”.

Our chance of salvaging something from the mess it created is being undermined by those selling false hope – either that Brexit can work, or that it can be easily undone. For the 16,000 businesses that have now given up trading with Europe because of paperwork, prospects remain bleak unless the government stops offering a sticking plaster and starts major surgery on our future with Europe.Forgive pro-Europeans for thinking the momentum is now with us. Labour has been slow to say what it wants from the EU reset, and slower still to acknowledge the inevitable tradeoffs required. Until the summer, ministers promised to “make Brexit work” and endlessly repeated “red lines”. Yet in recent weeks, a major study has found that leaving the EU cost the UK 6-8% of GDP per capita; now the chancellor calls the damage of Brexit “severe and long lasting”; the prime minister condemns the “wild promises” of the Leave campaign. Belatedly, a window of opportunity to change course may be opening.Stella Creasy is the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe and MP for Walthamstow Continue reading...</p>

You would expect one to cancel out the other, but here the narrative cracks forward with such certainty, you can afford the odd moment to laugh.It is funny that Baron Aaron (Tyler Collins) is deep in denial about his failed shipping business; that Beauty (Israela Efomi) carries with her a copy of an etiquette manual called How to Be a Lovely Young Lady; that her sister, Bright (Holly Howden Gilchrist), cares more for inventions than everyday expressions of affection; that the cat and dog (Michael Guest and Martin Donaghy) are falling ever so sweetly in love; and that the housekeeper Mrs Flobberlyboo (Elicia Daly) has a taste for modernist singing that makes the rest of Nikola Kodjabashia’s angular score seem conventional.

Rajiv Joseph explains why he brought the beast back from the dead for his Pulitzer-nominated dramaA play that dramatises the thoughts of a tiger on the bombed-out streets of Baghdad sounds outlandish. But Rajiv Joseph’s drama is rooted in a real incident during the invasion of Iraq. “I read the story,” he says, “that detailed how US bombs had blown open part of the zoo. The Bengal tiger had remained in its pen. All the zookeepers had fled, so this poor tiger was sitting there starving. One of the soldiers, who tried to feed it out of compassion, got his hand mauled. Another soldier shot and killed it.”It was 2003. The war was under way and Joseph, in his late 20s, was on a master’s programme at New York University. He took the tiger’s death as the starting point for a play with an absurdist kind of magical realism. After it is killed, the big cat returns as an anthropomorphic Dantean figure to interrogate the nature of God and the point of existence, all while padding around this hell on earth.

Plus, Naomi Fry delivers a rich deep dive into The Doors’ legacyThe popular show’s two-part special on the Fab Four has, bizarrely, prompted its Beatles sceptic co-host Dominic Sandbrook to refuse to appear. But his mega-starry replacement is Conan O’Brien, in for an engaging chat with Tom Holland through the career of John, Paul, George and Ringo. Their USP? Says Holland: “We’re a history podcast rather than a music podcast so we need to make the case that the Beatles are significant historically.” Alexi DugginsWidely available Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">Collateral comedy spins out from underneath the repression and violence charted in this sobering documentary that follows three indefatigable womenThere are many symptoms of totalitarian sickness gripping Alexander Lukashenko’s Belarus. You risk being arrested for wearing red and white together, the colours of the outlawed flag of the country’s opposition movement. Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four has been banned, which seems rather on the nose. But these are just some of the more farcical elements, the collateral comedy spinning from the deep repression, violence and psychological wounds charted in this sobering film that follows a trio of Belarusian activists, starting from the pandemic through to the invasion of Ukraine.Director Juliane Tutein fashions a melancholic mood-piece which chronicles ineffectualness in the face of impregnable state machinery, and the meaning of resistance under such circumstances. Nina, who is 74, is a kind of Belarusian Batman; an indefatigable symbol of protest who is immune to repression because of her fame. Human rights activist Darya runs her organisation in exile in Vilnius after student activism landed her in hot water. Tanya has stuck it out near Minsk while her husband and son have fled to Kyiv, but her human-rights NGO and film festival are in the authorities’ crosshairs. Continue reading...</p>

                    <p class="content-text">A meticulously researched account of the controversial businessman’s rise and shocking demiseAt least two terrible ironies surround the death of Mike Lynch. One lies in the name of his superyacht, which sank off the coast of Sicily in the early hours of 19 August 2024. He had named the boat Bayesian to honour Bayes’s theorem, a mathematical rule that helps you weigh up the probability of something given the available evidence, which served as Lynch’s guiding light over the course of a tempestuous career. The theorem was “a beautiful key to our minds”, Lynch believed. But it was entirely incapable of predicting the outcome that morning, when the yacht capsized during a storm, killing seven people, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter Hannah and his US lawyer, Chris Morvillo.A second irony lies in the fact that Lynch had just come through the trial of his life, one he felt was bound to end in jail, where he thought he could die.

Behind it, the mountains rise gently, their outlines caressed by the sun. The colours of autumn frame the 15th-century frescoes that embellish the structure’s interior, painted by Italian artist Aimone Duce, of the Lombard school. The chapel is the municipality’s oldest religious building, serving about 4,000 inhabitants, and stands on the site of a pre-existing building dating back to 1037.Inside the small chapel, my footsteps echo softly against the walls, breaking the stillness of the surrounding countryside. The sharp scent of plaster mingles with the earthy smell of the fields outside, carried in on the wind along with the sweetness of wheat. Light filters through the narrow windows, catching the vivid hues of a fresco that depicts the seven deadly sins – a theme often revisited in medieval iconography. Continue reading...</p>

A wise public would see red flags; instead it sees entertainmentOne upside of adversity is art, inspiring cultural output that seeks to process and channel suffering. “I’ll say one thing about Thatcher, some fantastic songs were written during her reign,” said the Irish singer Christy Moore once – before belting out a goosebump-raising rendition of Ordinary Man by Peter Hames, a song about the 1980s recession. That is, so far, the only upside of the publication of Olivia Nuzzi’s book American Canto, an affliction to journalism, politics and publishing: there has been some fantastic writing since it all kicked off.Masterful reviews. Very funny commentary. Scathing analysis. But first, a summary of events for readers of this column, most of whom I assume are well-adjusted, offline people, with better things to do with their time than follow what can only be described as a niche beef. Nuzzi is (or perhaps was, keep reading) a celebrated US political journalist who had a “digital affair” with Robert F Kennedy Jr while he was running for president, broke all sorts of journalistic rules while doing so, and was fired from her job at New York magazine. RFK Jr went on to become Donald Trump’s anti-vaccine health secretary, Nuzzi has published a book about the whole affair, and her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza – another political journalist – has been dripfeeding revelations about how she cheated on him, and a litany of other personal and professional transgressions.

                    <p class="content-text">A rich, buttery crumb, a hint of bittersweet coffee, a spot of icing and a cherry on top … better gift them before you scoff themThese festive cookies are inspired by The Nutcracker’s Land of Sweets sequence, in which coffee and sugar plums are two of the flavours used to conjure a fanciful world of decadent diversion. Anything from a hard candy to a candied fruit can qualify as a “sugar plum” and, in the case of these cookies, the sugar plum is represented by the amarena cherry. Coffee’s bitterness balances the sweetness of the fruit and the rich butteriness of the dough, while the oat flour adds a dash of shortbread-like delicateness.Brian Levy is the author of the Formal Assignment newsletter and Good & Sweet, published by Avery at £35.99.

                    <p class="content-text">Q&A with Jörg Meyer, CCO, Zattoo Broadband TV News speaks with Jörg Meyer about the company’s new modular product architecture and how it redefines flexibility for operators in the streaming economy. Broadband TV News: Zattoo has restructured its B2B portfolio. Why now? Jörg Meyer: The market has shifted faster than most infrastructures. Linear and OTT are now fully converged in the eyes of consumers, but operators are often still bound to legacy systems. Our long-standing end-to-end platform delivered simplicity, but today’s landscape demands something more flexible. The move to a Composable TV Platform gives operators the ability to modernize incrementally, integrate what they already have, and remain agile without the disruption of a full rebuild. BTN: What exactly does “Composable TV” mean in practice? Meyer: It means designing the entire system for interoperability. Instead of one rigid platform, operators get modular building blocks – our new Zattoo Ingest, Zattoo Stream, and Zattoo Orchestrate modules – plus Zattoo End2End for those who still want a turnkey option. They can adopt a single module to address a specific challenge or combine several to scale strategically. It’s evolution without disruption. BTN: Talk us through the modules briefly. Meyer: Zattoo Ingest replaces the traditional headend with a fully managed, cloud-native setup that handles ingest, encoding, packaging, and other related capabilities – removing a huge CapEx load. Zattoo Stream is the delivery engine, complete with APIs, device SDKs, and server-side ad insertion that operators can use to launch hybrid and ad-supported models quickly. Zattoo Orchestrate is the control plane – the operational and commercial brain – managing product logic, metadata, analytics, personalization, and OSS/BSS integrations. And Zattoo End2End remains our proven ready-made solution, but now powered by the same modular architecture, now facilitating the integration of third-party solutions for selected parts of the overall TV platform. Together, these form the Zattoo Platform Suite, scaling from small ISPs to Tier-1 broadcasters. BTN: How does this differentiate Zattoo from other technology providers? Meyer: Many systems describe themselves as modular but are monolithic underneath. We’ve truly decoupled the business logic layer from the infrastructure layer, which means operators can plug in or replace components without committing to a full technology migration. It also changes the financial model: operators shift from fixed, upfront CapEx to flexible OpEx that aligns with real usage and subscriber growth. That’s essential in today’s economic reality. BTN: How does the new approach support monetization? Meyer: With Zattoo Stream, operators can roll out targeted advertising immediately through Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI), creating new revenue without new infrastructure. And with Zattoo Orchestrate, they can experiment with pricing tiers, ad-supported models, or upsells without engineering-heavy backend work. It shortens the distance between commercial ideas and commercial impact. BTN: How important is Zattoo’s European footprint in all this? Meyer: Extremely important. Today, we operate End2End IPTV platforms in ten European countries – I’m not aware of any company with a similar presence. Europe’s regulatory and linguistic diversity has shaped how we build and operate platforms. Our technology is built in Europe for Europe, but globally scalable, giving local operators the confidence to compete with international platforms while staying compliant and reliable. BTN: Partnerships seem central to your strategy. Meyer: They are. No single vendor can cover every layer of the stack anymore. Our open, API-first architecture supports co-innovation – whether with frontend partners, or with analytics and AI providers. Openness is fundamental to composability. BTN: What is Zattoo’s mission going forward? Meyer: To give operators back control – over technology choices, economics, and innovation speed. The future belongs to those who can orchestrate complexity instead of being overwhelmed by it. Our modular suite is built to make that possible.

Do viewers really want to tech-direct the games they watch or follow multiple games at once? Is it most valuable to gamblers? Ateme's Francois Guilleautot, Major League Table Tennis's David Guinan, Roku's Joe Franzetta, and Ring Digital's Brian Ring speculate on the many possible futures of multiview streaming in this clip from Streaming Media 2025.</p>

It has, for now, been untouched by birds who cannily eat shorter-lived fruits first (wild raspberry, rowan, elder), leaving the solid drupes of holly until other food is scarce.

                    <p class="content-text">We can move from defensive crouch to position of strength but only if we use the economic cards we have against US coercionEurope is on a trajectory towards nothing less than “civilisational erasure”, the Trump administration claims in its extraordinary new National Security Strategy, a document that blames European integration and “activities of the European Union that undermine political liberty and sovereignty” for some of the continent’s deepest problems.Everybody should have seen it coming after Washington’s humiliating 28-point plan for Ukraine. JD Vance’s shocking Munich speech in February, in which he suggested that Europe’s democracies were not worth defending was an early red flag. But the new words still land as a shock. The security document is the clearest signal yet of how brutally and transactionally Washington wants to engage with the continent. It marks another phase in Trump’s attempt to reshape Europe in his ideological image while at the same time abandoning it militarily.

His right eye, lost in an attack on a rebel observation post he was manning in 2012, is covered by yellow medical tape. Propped against the wall is a cane he uses to walk, after a rocket attack in 2014 left him with a limp.For 14 years, Ali dreamed of freedom and of justice. A year after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, he has his freedom but not his justice. The man he was dreaming of holding accountable – a member of his extended family who was a part of an Assad militia – had already fled the country by the time Ali returned to his home in Damascus.

You didn’t have to explain why this mattered,” said the 60-year-old Pruszko, as he refreshed those skills at an army base outside Warsaw on a recent frosty Saturday morning. With dozens of other Polish civilians, he toured a bomb shelter, fitted gas masks and practised striking sparks from a flint to start a fire. Continue reading...</p>

Making Cover-Up, a film about his astonishing life and countless scoops, was never going to be easyOne morning last month, Seymour Hersh set off to buy a newspaper. The reporter walked for 30 minutes, covered six blocks of his neighbourhood, Georgetown in Washington DC, and didn’t see a single sign of life. No newsstands on street corners selling the glossies and the dailies. No self-service kiosk where you can slide in a dollar and pull out a paper. “Finally, I found a drugstore that had two copies of the New York Times in the back,” Hersh recalls. He bought one for himself. He can’t help but wonder whether anybody bought the second.Hersh was born in Chicago in 1937, the year the Hindenburg airship blew up and the aviator Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific. That makes him a man of hot metal, the media’s ancient mariner, with metaphorical newsprint on his fingers and a cuttings file that reads like an index of American misadventure. Hersh has been a staff writer at the New York Times and the New Yorker. He’s broken stories on Vietnam, Watergate, Gaza and Ukraine. But the free press is in crisis, newspapers are in flux and investigative journalism may be facing a deadline of its own. “I don’t think I could do now what I did 30, 40, 50 years ago,” says the now 88-year-old. “The outlets aren’t there. The money’s not there. So I don’t know where we all are right now.” Continue reading...</p>

Now, as her renaissance continues, she is taking on Mrs Malaprop in The RivalsAfter six decades as an actor, Patricia Hodge says she still gets nervous before a play opens. “I think nerves are always the fear of the unknown,” she says. “Particularly with comedy, where there is no knowing how the audience will react: you’ve got to surf that.”We meet on a sunny winter morning at the Orange Tree theatre in Richmond, south-west London, where Hodge is about to appear in The Rivals, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Richard B Sheridan play, in which she plays the ironic – sorry, iconic – Mrs Malaprop. “You’re sort of in a tunnel, your entire being is focused on this,” she says. She was here in rehearsals until 11pm the night before. Today, she is sitting at a table with a large coffee. Does she enjoy this bit, the putting together of a play? “I think it’s love-hate actually. The process is really why I do theatre.” She says she finds it energising, “but it’s also very trying, and you just don’t want to be left with your own limitations”. Continue reading...</p>

The move follows reports in the Guardian that have raised questions from MPs about the activities of Bloom, a billionaire who has made his money from gambling. Continue reading...</p>
