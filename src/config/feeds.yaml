# RSS Feed Sources Configuration
# Add your RSS feeds here

# Note: Some feeds may be rate-limited or blocked (e.g., The Verge returns 420 errors).
# The fetcher handles these gracefully - failed feeds are logged but don't stop processing.
# Articles from failed feeds are skipped and the build continues with successful sources.
